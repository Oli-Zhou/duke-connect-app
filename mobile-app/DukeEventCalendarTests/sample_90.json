Don't know where to begin?  This bootcamp is intended for employees who know their subject-matter, but don't know how to train another adult!  Most participants provide training to other employees or students as a small part of their job. L\u0026OD is providing a research-based background in adult learning principles and well established best practices.  These two topics combined with your knowledge and skills will provide the learner with a foundation for training adults.

Guided by the expertise of local Latinx artists, this ofrenda serves as a powerful homage to the rich cultural heritage and sacred traditions of the Day of the Dead.\n\nSeven artists from the Inter-Latin American Artist Collective (ILAAC) have created oversized calaveras, colorfully painted skulls traditionally used to decorate ofrendas, and transformed the space with traditional elements. Surrounding the gallery, visitors will find bright yellow and gold marigolds made of tissue paper to guide spirits to the ofrenda, papel picado (perforated paper) that symbolizes the union between life and death, and more.\n\nThis installation reminds visitors of the importance of honoring those who came before us, while fostering a sense of togetherness and understanding across cultural boundaries.\n\n###\nHow to Contribute:\nThe Ofrenda is open to the general public, and all visitors are invited to contribute to this meaningful project by adding photographs and objects that are representative of a departed loved one. Please note that we are unable to return offerings to the original owner, so please do not leave anything valuable or original. While a loved one's favorite food is traditional to offer during Day of the Dead, we ask that you leave only non-perishable food items, and no liquids at all. We encourage you to substitute perishable foods for photos, drawings, labels or other creative alternatives.\n\nJoin us at the Duke University Rubenstein Arts Center Gallery as we come together to celebrate, create, and pay homage to the Day of the Dead. Your participation will help weave a tapestry of memories and stories that transcend time, showcasing the enduring significance of this cherished tradition.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center Gallery | 2nd Floor","link":"https://dukearts.org/venues/rubenstein-arts-center-gallery/"},"contact":{"name":"Yanez, Yesenia","email":"yesenia.yanez@duke.edu","phone":"984-569-0680"},"categories":["Visual and Creative Arts","Central America focus","Exhibit"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5d2a688b-00004544demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://arts.duke.edu/news/announcing-dia-de-los-muertos-ofrenda-at-the-rubenstein-arts-center/","submitted_by":["ymy"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231018/c89b749002e65bd1ac44c01dee2178e7-CR-Day of the Dead Graphics 530 x 353 1_20231023033038PM.png","image_alt_text":"Graphic of 3 sugar skulls"},{"id":"CAL-2c918083-7bf1eaed-017c-150f18e4-0000595cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231019T040000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-10-19T04:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-07-18T04:00:00Z","summary":"Doing Good Employee Giving Campaign","description":"Doing Good, Duke's annual employee giving campaign, encourages Duke employees to donate to five community-identified need categories, including the United Way of the Greater Triangle.

It will include 9-10 speakers discussing their current theoretical challenges, and their attempts to find new approaches to burning questions. \n\nAs we near a second generation of thought, already rooted in the current century, the different literary departments' theoretical courses are still heavily reliant on 20th century theory. Against the backdrop of political upheavals, climate crisis, and the attempts to appropriate Judaism in Israel in the name of nationalistic ideas and forces, we ask: What are the urgent tasks of the study of Hebrew Literature? What can contemporary Hebrew literature scholarship contribute to these ongoing discussions? What are the current theoretical approaches that could be of use to us?\n\nIn this conference, we aim to discuss the possibilities and \"embarrassments\" of our particular point in time. This point in time being, both on a meta level: our own in-between career stage as post-docs and new PhDs, but also of this stage in history of Hebrew Literature, the current reality that might shape the thought of Hebrew literature, our field, in the near future. \n\nA keynote lecture by Saskia Ziolkowski, Associate Professor of Romance Studies at Duke University will open the conference.\n\nThe conference includes participants from the United States, as well as participants arriving from Israel and Europe and is comprised of emerging scholars.\n\nDiscussions will be held alternately in both Hebrew and English.\nהוֹ מְצִיאוּת, רוּחַ רְפָאִים קְטַנָּה שֶׁלִּי, פִּצְפּוֹנִית שֶׁלִּי, יָבוֹא\nיוֹם שֶׁאֲנָשִׁים יַבְחִינוּ בָּךְ. יָשִׂימוּ לֵב אֵלַיִךְ. יְדַבְּרוּ עָלַיִךְ.\nיִמְחֲאוּ לָךְ כַּפַּיִם. יָרִיעוּ לָךְ. יִרְצוּ לְהִתְקָרֵב אֵלַיִךְ. לָגַעַת\nבָּךְ. לָחוּשׁ אוֹתָךְ. לִשְׁמֹר עָלַיִךְ. לְשׂוֹחֵחַ אִתָּךְ. לְהָבִין. אַחַר\nכָּךְ תַּחְלִיטִי\n \n(חדוה הרכבי)\n \nAh Reality, my little ghost, my teeny-tiny one, the day will come \nwhen people will notice you.

The young, faith-tested Father Carras (Jason Miller) and elderly archeologist Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) prepare for an exorcism to vanquish the unholy evil.\n\nA timeless - often deemed cursed - horror masterpiece, the late, great William Friedkin's seminal adaptation of William Peter Blatty's \"The Exorcist\" remains every bit as chilling now as its first release in 1973.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Cinematic Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Film Theater","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Okazaki, Hank","email":"hokazak@duke.edu"},"categories":["Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-776e3438-0000363bdemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://cinematicarts.duke.edu/screensociety/screenings/rescheduled-exorcist-directors-cut-william-friedkin-1973","submitted_by":["sab141"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231029/50bf6491e0f7e6ab3a2e83f63152319a-CR-TheExorcist_20231028055903PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Still from The Exorcist"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-d0c25bd4-000014a0demobedework@mysite.edu_20231030T000000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-10-30T00:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-10-30T01:00:00Z","summary":"Catholic Mass in Duke Chapel","description":"Catholic Mass in Duke Chapel.

David Britt (UC Davis)\nTo learn more about the Britt lab's work, please visit their research page: http://brittepr.ucdavis.edu/ \n\n\nEPR Studies of the Enzymatic Synthesis of the Organometallic H-Cluster of [FeFe] Hydrogenase\n\nThe [FeFe] hydrogenase enzymes are well suited to H2 formation, producing up to 10000 H2 molecules per second, and have therefore generated much interest for renewable energy applications.  The H-cluster consists of a binuclear [2Fe]H subcluster which is linked via a bridging cysteine to a [4Fe-4S]H cluster. This [2Fe]H subcluster contains the organometallic elements of the H-cluster:  the two irons each have a CO and a CN- terminal ligand and are bridged by a third CO and a unique SCH2NHCH2S azadithiolate (adt) moiety. The H+ and H2 substrates are proposed to bind to and react at this [2Fe]H unit. In addition to the relative rarity of enzymes carrying out organometallic reactions, biosynthesis of the H-cluster poises some specific challenges. Of course, free CO and CN- molecules are toxic. In addition, the bridging adt moiety is known to be unstable in solution. The H-cluster biosynthesis is performed by a set of three \"maturase\" proteins, HydE, HydF, and HydG, each containing Fe-S clusters. Two of these, HydE and HydG, are members of the radical SAM superfamily of enzymes, while HydF is a GTPase. Our approach to developing a viable mechanistic proposal for H-cluster synthesis includes chemical biology techniques such as cell free synthesis, isotope sensitive spectroscopy such as electron paramagnetic resonance, and the use of synthetic clusters that can serve as functional substitutes for enzyme intermediates.\n\nHosted by David Beratan","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Chemistry","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"French Family Science Center 2237","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=33"},"contact":{"name":"Chem Admin Office","email":"chem-office@duke.edu"},"categories":["Natural Sciences","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-386d6907-00006a79demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["lao26"],"presenter":"R.

The module is designed for an introductory CS or data structures course. The demonstration does not involve programming but assumes students have programming experience in at least one programming language. We will begin with a real-world application of hash tables, then explain what hash tables are and their importance by\ncontrasting hashing to other alternatives. We will then introduce the concept of hash function and describe the goals and challenges of designing a good hash function. We will talk about collisions and possible approaches to resolving collisions. The lecture will also involve multiple active learning exercises to demonstrate how students can interleave between lecture and in-class activities to continue learning outside of the class.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I will talk about my research mentorship experience with undergraduate students. The talk will highlight my ongoing work with student researchers on interdisciplinary research projects centered around socially beneficial applications leading to research articles in natural science and behavioral science domains. I will conclude with my future vision to design courses, mentor undergraduate research, and organize outreach events to improve the student learning experience and to make computing education accessible as a strategy to promote diversity.\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nTahiya Chowdhury is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting faculty member of the Department of Computer Science at Colby College.

The Reverend Dr. Luka Ilic, Reformation Historian and Theologian, and Pastor in the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Württemberg (Balzheim), Germany  will be the speaker.\n\nIt is well documented that Martin Luther found it important to spend time with his colleagues, students, and those who supported the Reformation, listening to their concerns and giving spiritual advice. Being open about his own struggles and providing encouragement from the Word to those who experienced uncertainty and doubt about their faith made a profound difference in many people's lives. \n\nUrbanus Rhegius and Matthias Flacius Illyricus were among the Reformers who experienced life-changing pastoral care from Luther. \"Father Luther\" helped convert both to a deeper embrace of the Protestant faith and its cruciform understanding of the spiritual life. They, in turn, went on to shape the pastoral care that so defined the Protestant Reformation. This pastoral care still has much wisdom to offer the care of souls in contemporary church and society.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Duke Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, the Duke Divinity School Historical Division, and Duke Lutherans.

Hibernation was first documented in 350 BCE by Aristotle, who noted that some creatures give up eating and drinking in winter while concealing themselves in a \"sleep-like\" state for many months. Hibernation employs a collection of flexible physiological adaptations that allow animals to thrive in inhospitable environments, where they experience thermal challenges and scarcity of food and water for extended periods of time. Almost all mammalian orders include hibernators, suggesting that hibernation results from a modification of existing traits shared by all mammals. However, until recently, the molecular mechanisms that give rise to hibernation were largely unknown.\nThe long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand and to harness nature's ingenious adaptations to enable induction of hibernation in non-hibernating mammals, including humans.

This talk will describe some of the technical developments of ultra-high magnetic field, specialized gradients, novel rf detectors and creative signal processing that have allowed us to achieve spatial resolution more than 2 million times that of clinical MRI. The methods have been translated from laboratory curiosity to routine practice providing new insights into a range of mouse models of disease. We will include applications in mouse models of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. \n\nDr. G. Allan (Al) Johnson completed his BA in mathematics and physics at St. Olaf College, Northfield Minnesota in 1969. He completed his Ph.D. in physics at Duke University in 1974 and joined the department of radiology at Duke that same year. He served as the first Director of Diagnostic Physics for Duke Medical Center from 1979-2009. During that period, he had the good fortune to work in close collaboration with colleagues at GE Medical Systems in installing the world's first high field (1.5T) clinical MRI at Duke in 1983. Much of the early work was performed on dogs. A desire to limit studies on dogs lead Dr Johnson to ask how might MRI systems be adapted to higher spatial resolution (for mice and rats). He demonstrated the first in vivo images of rats at microscopic resolution in 1986. That same year he established The Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy, an NIH National Resource dedicated to further the development and application of MR microscopy. He and his colleagues at the CIVM have continued to push the spatial resolution of MRI through development of specialized high field (9.4T) systems with high- performance gradients and RF coils and novel methods of encoding. Many of the advances are consequences of extensive collaboration with colleagues at Berkley, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh University, NIEHS and elsewhere. He is a Senior Fellow of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and the Academy of Radiology. He is the Charles E.

Binary Heaps\nI will present the heap data structure. Two properties define a heap. First, it is a complete binary tree, so it is implemented using the array representation for complete binary trees. Second, the values stored in a heap are partially ordered. This means that there is a relationship between the value stored at any node and the values of its children. Due to its space and time efficiency, the heap is a popular choice for implementing a priority queue. \n\n2. AP CS A Outreach program \nI will present the outreach program between Penn Engineering and the non-profit Heights Phila I am coordinating. The program's goals are: (1) to expand CS access \u0026 excellence across Philadelphia and (2) to prepare students for the AP CS A exam. The program runs year-long, with in-person and online instruction during the school year and in-person during the summer. Since its inception, the number of students enrolled has more than doubled, and more than 75% of the students who took the AP CS A exam passed with a score of 3 or above). I will also discuss future outreach, teaching, and research ideas and what makes Duke University a great place to implement those projects. \n\nSPEAKER BIO \nDr. Eric Fouh is an Assistant Practice Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches a variety of introductory and advanced courses.

When these degrees of freedom are entangled through a relativistic spin-orbit-coupling, quantum fluctuations can be enhanced, engendering diverse quantum phases of matter. The most celebrated example is the Kitaev quantum spin liquid for j=1/2 Kramers doublets on the honeycomb lattice. However, spin-orbital fluctuations can lead to many other possibilities, including multi-polar order, and spin orbitals liquids. In this talk, I will discuss specific examples of spin and orbital dynamics of two model face centered cubic antiferromagnets: GaTa4Se8, that realizes an orbitally active j=3/2 model; and K2IrCl6 that realizes a j=½ antiferromagnet.  GaTa4Se8 is a cluster Mott insulating lacunar spinel, where electrons occupy molecular orbitals that retain spin and orbital angular momentum. I will discuss neutron scattering measurements on this material that reveal a dynamical spin-orbital state preceding an order-disorder type spin-orbital ordering transition. Spin-orbit coupling overcomes the Jahn-Teller mechanism in GaTa4Se8 and results in a novel spin-orbital valence bond ground state. K2IrCl6 is a highly frustrated antiferromagnet with dominant Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions. I will present inelastic neutron scattering measurements on this compound that show a striking dichotomy of the static and dynamic correlations. Static correlations resemble a classically ordered state, but the dynamic correlations reveal a dominance of quantum fluctuations and a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. These results showcase the power of neutron scattering to reveal spin and orbital dynamics in quantum materials.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Physics","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"None"},"contact":{"name":"Frazier.

We introduce a novel empirical test of standard neoclassical models of fertility that directly tests the prediction of opposite-signed income and intertemporal substitution effects of business cycles by examining the interaction of the aggregate unemployment rate with a measure of potential income replacement from UI. Our results show that as UI benefit generosity reaches 100 percent income replacement, there is no effect of the unemployment rate on births. This implies that the well-documented cyclical nature of births is about access to liquidity. We also provide novel evidence that infant health is countercyclical based on timing of conception, but procyclical based on time in utero. The negative relationship between the in utero aggregate unemployment rate and infant health also disappears when potential UI replacement rates reach 100 percent. Our results imply that the social insurance provided by UI has a pro-natalist effect and improves the health and economic well-being of the next generation.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Population Research Institute (DuPRI)","co_sponsors":["Social Science Research Institute (SSRI)"],"location":{"address":"SSRI-Gross Hall 270","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=203"},"contact":{"name":"None"},"categories":["Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-1e85d902-00000433demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://dupri.duke.edu/news-events/events/melissa-kearney-professor-economics-university-maryland-presents-cyclicality","submitted_by":["my109"],"series-name":"DUPRI Seminar Series","presenter":"Melissa Kearney - University of Maryland"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-ae92dfce-00000a50demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T16:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:15:00Z","summary":"CCDGB: Bayo Akomolafe, \"Becoming-black: On white syncopation at the end of the world\"","description":"Please join the Climate Change, Decolonization, and Global Blackness Lab (CCDGB) at the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute for our 2023-24 speaker series. CCDGB is part of The Entanglement Project, an FHI initiative focused on the intersections of race, health, and climate.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER: Bayo Akomolafe, Ph.D., is a widely celebrated international speaker, posthumanist thinker, poet, teacher, public intellectual, essayist, and author of two books, /These Wilds Beyond our Fences: Letters to My Daughter on Humanity's Search for Home/ and /We Will Tell our Own Story: The Lions of Africa Speak/. He is the Founder of The Emergence Network and host of the postactivist course/festival/event, 'We Will Dance with Mountains'. He currently lectures at Pacifica Graduate Institute, California. He sits on the Board of many organizations including Science and Non-Duality (US) and Ancient Futures (Australia). In July 2022, Dr. Akomolafe was appointed the inaugural Global Senior Fellow of UC Berkeley's Othering and Belonging Institute. He has also been Fellow for The New Institute in Hamburg, Germany, and Visiting Critic-in-Residence for the Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles (2023). He is the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), among other recognitions.\n\nABOUT THE LECTURE: The Yorubas have a proverb: \"In order to find your way, you must lose it.\" In this talk, Dr. Bayo Akomolafe draws from the transatlantic excursions of the Yoruba deities known as orishas and the concept of 'ase' to reframe blackness as a more-than-human, counterhegemonic flow of indeterminacy that \"maddens the imperial individual\" and teases apart the project of stability from an \"external within.\" This coming-apart is white syncopation, also known as becoming-black. \"Not a becoming 'Black', but a becoming 'black'. A becoming-monster. A losing one's way. A veering off-course. A becoming-imperceptible....[which] is not necessarily about building new institutions, winning legislative victories, receiving reparations, or gaining greater representation and visibility.\" Akomolafe suggests that this becoming-black is the condition for the emergence of an autistic politics that cradles 'the minor gesture' (Erin Manning) as a response to contemporary crises.\n\nIN-PERSON REGISTRATION: https://duke.is/yc4gm\nZOOM REGISTRATION: https://duke.is/c/tjhj","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"None"},"contact":{"name":"Franklin Humanities Institute","email":"fhi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Climate","Sustainability","Africa focus","Global","Humanities","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-ae92dfce-00000a50demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cmc7"],"webcast-url":"https://duke.is/yc4gm","series-name":"Climate Change, Decolonization \u0026 Global Blackness","presenter":"Bayo Akomolafe","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231102/9857dea25e83ebf6240039341542b3ff-CR-CCDGB square w Entanglement Proj_20230919055255PM.png","image_alt_text":"Climate Change, Decolonization \u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Global Blackness logo"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-018a-04bff167-00007ae7demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T16:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:30:00Z","summary":"Thursday Seminar Series","description":"Elda Grabocka, Ph.D., Thomas Jefferson University\nHost: Stefano Di Talia","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Molecular Genetics and Microbiology (MGM)","co_sponsors":["Cell Biology","Program in Cell and Molecular Biology","School of Medicine (SOM)"],"location":{"address":"Nanaline Duke 147","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=69"},"contact":{"name":"Kennett, Annette","email":"annette.kennett@duke.edu","phone":"919-613-8636"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-018a-04bff167-00007ae7demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["kenne031"],"series-name":"Thursday Seminer Series","presenter":"Elda Grabocka, Ph.D."},{"id":"CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97bda488-00001161demobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T19:00:00Z","summary":"Academic Advising Center Drop-in Advising","description":"Drop by the AAC with quick advising questions or to get additional input on your academic plans.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Academic Advising Center (AAC)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Academic Advising Center","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=172"},"contact":{"name":"Hoff, Jen","email":"jen.hoff@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-2054"},"categories":["Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97bda488-00001161demobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jdh106"],"webcast-url":"https://advising.duke.edu/"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-a4e85da8-000071ffdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:45:00Z","summary":"Organ Demonstration","description":"This organ demonstration is an opportunity to stop in to hear a Duke Chapel organ or Bösendorfer grand piano played in the informal atmosphere of an open rehearsal.

Orphaned and estranged, the Syriani children raised themselves while they lived with hate, anger and confusion as the man they could only refer to as \"Him Him\" lived on death row.

Yet, for all its familiarity, Beethoven's music is enigmatic and full of contradictions. This program, featuring two works for violin and piano, shows his contrasts in spirit, as the relatively brief and serenely beautiful \"Romance in F\" stands opposite the epic \"Kreutzer\" sonata, a large, tense work of great virtuosity and emotional depth. Paired as a modern foil on this program is American composer Daniel Temkin. His colorful trio \"Maksimal\" for violin, piano, and percussion reflects and illuminates particular elements of Beethoven's own sensibility, as short motivic cells, fiery rhythms, poignant melodies, and bold textural shifts coalesce to form large-scale architectures and sound worlds. Heard together, these pieces reveal emotional depths and a sense of musical organicism that speaks across time, genres, and place. \n\nNoted individually for their brilliant artistry and musical creativity, violinist Ariana Kim and pianist Ieva Jokubaviciute have performed together as a duo for over a decade. Appearing together in concerts, teaching residencies, and festivals, the duo has also commissioned and recorded numerous works together. Originally\nexisting as a violin concerto, \"Maksimal\" was arranged for the duo in 2019. \n\nCo-Artistic Director of both Chamber Music Society of Minnesota and the Paesaggi Musicali Toscani Festival in Italy, violinist Ariana Kim performs around the world as a soloist and chamber artist. She is a professor at Cornell University. \n\nA professor at Duke University, Ieva Jokubaviciute is veteran artist of Marlboro, Ravinia, Kneisel Hall, and other top festivals. She is a Naumburg Chamber Music laureate and recipient of the prestigious Borletti-Buitoni Fellowship. \n\nAn award-winning composer, Daniel Temkin's music has been heard worldwide at the Intimacy of Creativity Festival, Dresden Music Festival, Bath Festival, Banff Centre, and many others. As a percussionist, he has played with the Orchestra of St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, the Riverside Choral society, and the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), among others.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Music","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"East Duke 201 - Nelson Music Room","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=157"},"contact":{"name":"Duke Music","email":"duke-music@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-22a4ea22-00000a98demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://music.duke.edu","submitted_by":["ethomps"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231102/d0b2b109dacbe3e9b1f092ec22de3ab3-CR-Kim_Joku_Temkin_20230823014547PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Headshots of Ariana Kim, Ieva Jokubaviciute, and Daniel Temkin"},{"id":"CAL-2c918083-7bf1eaed-017c-150f18e4-0000595cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231103T040000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T04:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-08-02T04:00:00Z","summary":"Doing Good Employee Giving Campaign","description":"Doing Good, Duke's annual employee giving campaign, encourages Duke employees to donate to five community-identified need categories, including the United Way of the Greater Triangle.

Breakfast is served at 9 am and the lecture begins promptly at 9:30 am.\n\nElectric Voice: Tactility and Tacticality in Revolutionary Iran -\n\nThe economic boycott of Nokia phones by Iranian protestors in the summer of 2009 marks one historical instance of their vanguardist tactics in relation the economies of a global medium. The boycott was an early tactical measure that was directly linked to the tactility and sensorial closeness of lightweight digital devices as the people attempted to reclaim their democratic rights and civil liberties in Iran after a fraudulent election. Though largely dismissed at the time, the Nokia boycott had the potential to draw the attention of a watchful global collective towards the huge collection of data underway -- data that would be used to advance machine learning in years that followed. Right there, in the electrifying rage of that moment's digital collectivity and expansive freedom, lay the evolutionary beginnings of an algorithmic logic that would come to strangle the electric voice by bolstering online platforms for maximum capital gain. The presentation considers the transformation of global media in relation to the voices of a people in revolt.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nNegar Mottahedeh teaches media studies in the Program in Literature at Duke University. Her research on film, social media, and social movements in the Middle East has been published by Stanford University Press, Syracuse University Press, Duke University Press and in WIRED magazine,The Hill, Salon.com, The Observer and The Wall Street Journal.

AERPAW supports large-scale outdoor advanced wireless experiments with autonomous unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs) and it is remotely accessible by the nationwide research community. Users of AERPAW have the opportunity to design and rapidly prototype next-generation wireless technologies, systems, and applications in both emulated and real-world environments. This talk will review the overall scope, and existing outdoor infrastructure including eight dedicated fixed nodes (towers, rooftop nodes, and a light pole) and their capabilities, as well as future plans for the AERPAW project. We will describe various different experiment examples involving software-defined radios, a commercial Ericsson 4G/5G network, RF sensors from Keysight, and a smart agriculture system with various LoRa gateways and sensors, all of them interacting with autonomous UAVs and UGVs in a large-scale outdoor environment. We will overview our digital twin that allows AERPAW users to exclusively design their outdoor experiments in a containerized virtual environment. We will also provide various research examples carried out on the platform since AERPAW declared general availability in November 2021.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Hudson Hall 125","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=101"},"contact":{"name":"Rice, Cynthia","email":"cynthia.rice@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-5252"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-a9a87308-00003c45demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cpr24"],"presenter":"Ismail Guvenc","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/20030f01a4e6d9fa5463e07a3f647f20-CR-ISMAIL GUVENC_20230919081459PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"ISMAIL GUVENC"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-165e68ab-000031d2demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T19:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-03T20:30:00Z","summary":"BME Virtual Open House","description":"Join Duke Biomedical Engineering at our Virtual Open House.

As he acclimates to the new job, Haider becomes infatuated with the strong-willed trans woman Biba who runs the show-an unforeseen partnership that opens his eyes and ultimately his worldview, in ways both unexpected and intimate.\n\n\"An aching consideration of gender and sexuality.\" - Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Brims with physical and emotional energy.\" - Siddhant Adlakha, Indiewire","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Cinematic Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Film Theater","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Okazaki, Hank","email":"hokazak@duke.edu"},"categories":["Asia focus","Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5e564bd1-00005be2demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://cinematicarts.duke.edu/screensociety/screenings/joyland-saim-sadiq-2022","submitted_by":["sab141"],"presenter":"Introduced by Shiraz Ahmed (MFA in Experimental \u0026 Documentary Arts)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/d949a259233194a4f3f60d00418326f0-CR-Joyland-Still-2-2048x1152_20231023085955PM.png","image_alt_text":"Still from Joyland"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-8a73e478-00003a80demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T23:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-04T00:00:00Z","summary":"Hungry for Change: Ending Food Waste","description":"Join us during Duke's Family Weekend to hear from Jasmine Crowe-Houston, social entrepreneur, TED speaker, and founder and CEO of Goodr!\n\nFrom 6-7pm there will be a reception at the Bryan Center's: The Landing, followed by a keynote and moderated Q\u0026A in Reynold's Theater from 7-8pm where Jasmine will explain how she built a tech company to solve two of the world's biggest problems: hunger and food waste.

Brown, director, and Evan Roberson, associate director, as they welcome saxophonist Gregory Tardy and Derrick Gardner to the Baldwin stage for this special Family Weekend concert that kicks off a season celebrating John Brown's 20th year as Director of the Jazz Program at Duke. \n\n$10 general admission/free for students. Tickets: https://tickets.duke.edu.\n\n\"Big sound, deep seated feel for the blues, and cerebral avante-garde chops,\" is how New York Magazine describes saxophonist, multi-reedist, and composer Gregory Tardy. Tardy is one of the most versatile jazz musicians of his generation, equally comfortable in a variety of musical and improvisational situations. In 1992, he started playing with legendary drummer Elvin Jones, and he recorded his first CD, \"Crazy Love.\" Tardy has played with many prominent jazz artists including Wynton Marsalis, Jay McShann, Nicholas Payton, Roy Hargrove, Steve Coleman, Betty Carter, Don Byron, Bill Frisell, Rashied Ali, Ellis Marsalis, Brian Lynch and John Patitucci, among others. His performances have taken him around the world, playing at all of the major jazz festivals and on some of the biggest stages in jazz. As a sideman, he has been featured on several Downbeat Albums of the Year and also several Grammy nominated recordings; including a Grammy winning CD with Brian Lynch in 2006. He also has recorded fourteen CDs under his own name featuring his unique compositions, blending his love of traditional jazz with a more modern seeking style. His latest project, \"If Time Could Stand Still,\" was released in the fall of 2020 on WJ3 Records. \n\nJazz trumpeter Derrick Gardner is inspired by the finest hard-blowing funky bop bands of the 1960's. Gardner quickly made his mark when he arrived on the New York jazz scene in 1991. There he began an illustrious career that has taken him around the world performing internationally with the Count Basie Orchestra, (1991-present), Frank Foster's Loud Minority Band, Harry Connick Jr.'s Big Band, The Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and Swiss tenor player Roman Schwaller's European Sextet. Over the last 29 years, he has worked with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, George Benson, Frank Foster, Jon Faddis, Nancy Wilson and Tony Bennett. He formed his own sextet, The Jazz Prophets, in 1991; it continues to be one of the primary vehicles for his distinctive, hard-driving music.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Music","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Baldwin Auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=291"},"contact":{"name":"Duke University Box Office","email":"tickets@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music","Parents' and Family Weekend"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-22bb8959-00000b9edemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://tickets.duke.edu","submitted_by":["ethomps"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/3e458c3d300b8b279e8de543eaca1197-CR-Tardy_and_Gardner_web_20231009092341PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Gregory Tardy standing against a glass wall with his reflection mirrored in it, and a headshot of Derrick Gardner holding his trumpet."},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-846f3d55-00004508demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-04T03:55:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-04T04:00:00Z","summary":" Apply now!

Based on Alberto Moravia's novel \"Il Disprezzo\", \"Contempt\" is a brilliant study of marital breakdown, artistic compromise, and the cinematic process.\n\n\"Trailer of a Film That Will Never Exist: Phony Wars\"\n(Jean-Luc Godard, 2023, 20 min, France, DCP)\n\nAt the time of his death in September 2022, Jean-Luc Godard had been in the midst of planning another feature, an adaptation of Belgian author Charles Plisnier's 1937 novel \"Faux Passports\". Though the film was never produced, the intricate and beautiful \"trailer\" that Godard put together in preparation now stands as his final work, a complex collage of history, politics, and cinema constructed of paper and glue, paintings and photographs, sound and silence. Godard often transformed his synopses into aesthetic programs. His swan song follows in this tradition and will remain as the ultimate gesture of cinema, which he accompanies with the following text: \"Rejecting the billions of alphabetic diktats to liberate the incessant metamorphoses and metaphors of a necessary and true language by returning to the locations of past film shoots, while keeping track of modern times.\"\n\n-- Official Selection: Cannes Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, New York Film Festival.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Cinematic Arts","co_sponsors":["Center for French and Francophone Studies"],"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Film Theater","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Okazaki, Hank","email":"hokazak@duke.edu"},"categories":["Europe focus","Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5e5b7147-00005c28demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://cinematicarts.duke.edu/screensociety/screenings/tribute-jean-luc-godard-1930-2022-contempt-1963-trailer-film-2023","submitted_by":["sab141"],"presenter":"Introduced by Prof. Anne-Gaëlle Saliot (Romance Studies/Cinematic Arts)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231104/0850758bbd82e56ebe282a147bd44007-CR-contempt 2_20231023090532PM.jpeg","image_alt_text":"Still from Contempt"},{"id":"CAL-8a0290b4-860465b2-0186-ebdcac01-00007373demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-04T22:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-05T03:00:00Z","summary":"A Fantastic Journey: Honoring Wangechi Mutu","description":"The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University presents a festive evening in honor of artist Wangechi Mutu and her monumental sculpture MamaRay. \n\nLead sponsor: Duke Health","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Nasher Museum of Art","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Nasher Museum of Art","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=208"},"contact":{"name":"Hower, Wendy","email":"wendy.hower@duke.edu"},"categories":["Visual and Creative Arts","Social","Charity/Fundraising","Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0290b4-860465b2-0186-ebdcac01-00007373demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://nasher.duke.edu/tickets-for-a-fantastic-journey/","submitted_by":["whower"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231104/511f3c2fb6ef6107e6a2fe27e8ebb9ff-CR-2023-03-14_Webpage_2_20230316071912PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Wangechi Mutu with her monumental sculpture MamaRay"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-22c1ba99-00000d20demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-04T23:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-04T23:00:00Z","summary":"Family Weekend Concert: Duke Chorale, Symphony Orchestra, and Wind Symphony","description":"Three of Duke's largest student music ensembles-- the Duke Chorale, directed by Allan Friedman; Duke Symphony Orchestra, directed by Harry Davidson; and Duke Wind Symphony, directed by Verena Mösenbichler-Bryant, celebrate Family Weekend with a showcase concert featuring an eclectic selection of works. \n\n$10 general admission/free for students.

At that time, the Modern Black Mass Choir was organized in a local church for Duke's Black students; it was then reorganized as a Duke student group in 1972. Sometimes referred to as The Black Mass Choir, the group performed throughout North Carolina and neighboring states in addition to hosting regular concerts on Duke campus. During the 1997-1998 academic year, the group expanded to include a praise dance ministry as well as a gospel choir and also adopted the name United in Praise to represent the diversity of the choir members and to emphasize its purpose. The group is advised by the Rev. Racquel Gill, the Chapel's minister for intercultural engagement.\n\nSomething Borrowed Something Blue is a co-ed Christian a cappella ensemble, consisting of students who love God and love to sing. Originally founded in 1969 as a Christian folk band, the ensemble adopted its current name in 1993 as a reference to weddings and the church being called the beloved bride of Christ in the Bible.

The expected reaction-ugly misogyny-is certainly one part of the answer. But peculiarities of this book as a whole, and of the other images in it transform the image into one that deserves further and deeper consideration. \n\nMarc  Michael Epstein, Professor on the Mackie M. Paschall (1899) \u0026 Norman Davis Chair in Religion and Visual Culture at Vassar College was Vassar's  first Director of Jewish Studies. He is a graduate of  Oberlin College, received the PhD at Yale University, and did much of  his  graduate research at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He has written on various topics in visual and material culture produced by, for, and about Jews.  His 2011 book, The Medieval Haggadah: Art, Narrative, and Religious Imagination (Yale University Press) was selected by the London Times Literary Supplement as one of the best books of the year. His 2015 Skies of Parchment, Seas of Ink: Jewish Manuscript Illumination (Princeton University Press)-a magisterial large-format survey of the genre with over 300 illustrations in brilliant digital color-was the winner of the National Jewish Book Award. His latest work, People of the Image: Jews \u0026 Art, will be published by Penn State University Press later this year.  During  the 80s, Epstein was  Director of the Hebrew Books and Manuscripts division  of Sotheby's Judaica department, and continues to serve as consultant to various  libraries, auction houses, museums and private collectors throughout the world. He currently serves as the director of Beit Venezia, The Home of Jewish Culture, in Venice Italy.\n\nThis lecture is part of the NC Jewish Studies Consortium sponsored by Appalachian State University, North Carolina State University, Elon University, UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC-Wilmington, Wake Forest University","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Center for Jewish Studies","co_sponsors":["Art, Art History \u0026 Visual Studies","David M.

Compellingly, these techniques have become invaluable tools for applications ranging from topology optimization, to uncertainty quantification, to real-time prediction, to multi-scale modeling and beyond. Typically, researchers take either a \"problem-centric\" or \"model-centric\" approach to this work. Namely, they focus on either an overarching engineering challenge, or they focus on developing machine learning methods and model architectures. In this talk, we will present a \"data-centric\" approach to data driven modeling of mechanical systems. Specifically, we will discuss work where we focus on defining and curating datasets as our top priority [1]. First, we will share our work in developing and disseminating benchmark datasets for engineering mechanics problems [2, 3]. In addition to describing these datasets, we will also discuss our recent work in investigating deep learning model calibration [4]. Then, we will share our work in defining an open science based methodological foundation for data driven modeling of (bio)mechanical systems. In brief, we envision a methodological framework with three essential components: (1) open access datasets, (2) open source software to extract interpretable quantities of interest from these data, and (3) combined mechanistic and statistical models of (bio)mechanical behavior informed by these data. As an illustrative example, we will discuss our recent collaborative work in cardiac tissue engineering [5, 6]. Overall, the goal of this talk is to spark discussion and inspire future work on \"data-centric\" approaches to mechanical modeling. \n\n[1] https://imechanica.org/node/25935 \n[2] https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/39371\n[3] https://elejeune11.github.io/\n[4] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2023.104749\n[5] https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05322\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04610","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side A, room 1464","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98"},"contact":{"name":"Hinz, Nicolle","email":"nicolle.hinz@duke.edu","phone":"832-279-0092"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-14f92cd9-00001729demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"http://cee.duke.edu","submitted_by":["nh143"],"series-name":"CEE Fall Seminar Series 2023","presenter":"Emma Lejeune, Boston University, Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231106/4fc594972373782eba66ce5a63bc9f1a-CR-Lejeune_headshot[47]_20231009030555PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Emma Lejeune"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd0aa134-00000fc9demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-06T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-06T18:00:00Z","summary":"Prediction-driven Surge Planning with Application in the Emergency Department","description":"LUNCH: \nLunch will be served at 11:45 AM. \n\nABSTRACT: \nDetermining emergency department (ED) nurse staffing decisions to balance the quality of service and staffing cost can be extremely challenging, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty in patient demand. Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand uncertainty by utilizing demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction-driven staffing framework where the prediction models are integrated with the base (made weeks in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of having the ability to use the more expensive surge staffing and identify the importance of balancing demand uncertainty versus demand stochasticity. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Lastly, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and capacity sizing in the ED. Simulation experiments for the ED demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce annual staffing costs by 11%-16% ($2 M-$3 M) while guaranteeing timely access to care. \n\nSPEAKER BIO: \nJing Dong is the Regina Pitaro Associate Professor of Business in the Decision, Risk, and Operations Division at Columbia Business School.

But demographic shifts--narrowing of nuclear family consciousness, a high aging population, fewer children getting born, a decrease in marriage and co-habitation, an increase in single households--are changing this.\n\nToday, fewer Japanese have the option, or desire, for burial in the family grave. But where to go instead, and how to find mortuary support? \n\nIn the move to find alternatives to the family grave, Haruyo Inoue has been a pioneer in Japan. A sociologist and a practitioner who started Ending Center, one of the first alternative burial grounds in Japan where burial is by cherry blossoms (桜葬sakurasō) instead of the family grave, Professor Inoue will speak of the \"inclusive relationality\" (結縁) promoted here, and of the ending support given to single Japanese (おひとり様 ohitorisama).\n\n--Note: this talk will be delivered in Japanese with interpretation by Dr. Jieun Cho.--\n\nAbout the speaker:\nHaruyo Inoue is a retired professor of Toyo University, a visiting research fellow at the Institutes of Social Sciences and Contemporary Society at Toyo University, the director of NPO Ending Center, and a representative of the Ending Design Institute.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Cultural Anthropology"],"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Library Carpenter Conference Room 249","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1872"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Medicine","Asia focus","Ethics","Human Rights","Global","Humanities","Social Sciences","Health/Wellness","Lecture/Talk","Religious/Spiritual"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-9a8357f5-000039eddemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["acn13"],"presenter":"Haruyo Inoue (Toyo University)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231107/73f16ae2d6291064f44bc05e9c2b0df9-CR-231107_Inoue_20230922030349PM.png","image_alt_text":"Headshot of Prof. Haruyo Inoue; photo of a blooming cherry tree by a waterfall and stream; descriptive text (title, date, time, location)"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-81714792-00003108demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-07T19:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-07T21:00:00Z","summary":"Try This, Not That: Overwintering Tropical Plants","description":"Duke Gardens is home to some impressive horticulture.

More recently, with the wide adoption of smart home devices and high-functioning smartphones, conversational agents (e.g., Alexa, Siri) increasingly became available in people's everyday lives, such as Alexa, Siri, or automobile driver's interfaces. Furthermore, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has gained public attention, and the possibilities of generative conversational artificial intelligence (GCAI) systems show potential to support people's health in everyday lives. In this talk, I will discuss a few projects investigating the opportunities and challenges of GCAI becoming integrated into technology supporting various health needs, including mental health, parenting young children, and caregiving individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. I discuss various roles GCAI can play, its feasibility in interacting safely and appropriately with end-users and challenges that remain in GCAI becoming an integral part of health informatics applications.\n\t\nInstructor Biosketch:\nDr. Jina Huh-Yoo is an associate professor in the College of Computing and Informatics at Drexel University and a Director of the Master in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at Drexel.

Does this entreaty apply to the composition of poetry as well? To every sentence we form? Every thought that arises?\n\nI'm a poet whose primary research is in the field of Prosody. Prosody is the interplay between speech and song. It's the intonational, rhythmic, musical, interactive aspects of language. It is also definable as poetry's basic elements of composition (stress, intensity, pause, pitch, timbre, mood, etc.). Initially, I sought out Tibetan Medicine only in order to practice mantra (which is integral to Tibetan Medicine) as the most potent form of phonic sound.\n\nAs a student of mantra ('mind protection') I had no intention of practicing Tibetan Medicine which is tantric (tantra, 'body protection'). During the pandemic, my Tibetan teacher made the decision to go online and teach Sowa Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan Medicine), and I accepted an invitation to be interviewed. My resistance to this medical practice was elemental: 5 element theory, the 3 humors, the 3 poisons, and the one primary cause of disease (ignorance, ma rigpa, or avidyā) were foreign to me. In the interview it was pointed out to me that the mandala from which Sowa Rigpa emanates (a garden called Tanaduk) is the abode of the poets (the rishis, the same sage/poets who received the Vedic hymns). Right away, I asked my teacher: what are the rishis doing in there? His answer basically reconstituted my life.\n\nI'd like to show the interrelationship between Sowa Rigpa and prosody, the composition of health, with prosody understood in this context as bearing properties such as vibration, vibrancy, timing, attuning, intoning, intent, interacting, proportioning, and equipoise.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Humanities Unbounded","co_sponsors":["Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)"],"location":{"address":"Smith Warehouse, Ahmadieh Family Lecture Hall, Bay 4, C105","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1874"},"contact":{"name":"Gaglia, Nicole","email":"nyg3@duke.edu","phone":"919-684-2224"},"categories":["Medicine","Visual and Creative Arts","Asia focus","Humanities","Lecture/Talk","Religious/Spiritual"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-3e9b089f-00005ec7demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["nyg3"],"presenter":"Robert Kocik","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231108/73279d7becba51095cc57ca8be4ea9f3-CR-Entanglement SL - Kocik - 20231108_20231027052918PM.jpeg","image_alt_text":"Headshot of speaker with event information"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72eb050b-0000181fdemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-08T22:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-08T23:00:00Z","summary":"What Nobody Tells You: Offer Letters","description":"Are you currently in the job market and are looking to begin applying, interviewing, and landing your next opportunity, soon?

The groundbreaking mission of Women Cross DMZ is captured in an intimate cinema vérité style, framed with historic newsreels of the Korean War, punctuated with dramatic contemporary news coverage.\n\nFrom threats of annihilation to promises of peace, U.S.-North Korea relations provide key moments of drama throughout the story. But the film's protagonists are thirty women activists who dare to tread forbidden territory to draw global attention to the unresolved war and demand a seat at the table in bringing about peace. Korean American Christine Ahn rallies the group, including feminist pioneer Gloria Steinem and Nobel Peace Laureates Leymah Gbowee and Mairead Maguire.\n\nThe intrepid team faces daunting political hurdles as they make their way toward the DMZ. The challenges the women face, the obstacles they overcome, and the solidarity and trust they build as they forge a path to peace with their Korean sisters, is an inspiring story of bridge building and collective action.\n\nAbout the speakers:\nDeann Borshay Liem is an Emmy Award-winning documentarian known for films that explore war, memory, family and identity including her landmark adoption films \"First Person Plural,\" \"In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee,\" and \"Geographies of Kinship.\" Her work on the Korean War, including \"Memory of Forgotten War,\" \"Crossings,\" and the oral history project, \"Legacies of the Korean War,\" explores divided families and women's role in peacemaking. She is a producer for the ITVS-supported film, \"Vivien's Wild Ride,\" and is directing a new documentary that looks at the intersections between US military occupation, Korean military brides, and transnational adoption.\n\nProfessor Suzy Kim is a historian and author of the prize-winning \"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950\" (Cornell 2013). Her latest book, \"Among Women across Worlds: North Korea in the Global Cold War,\" was completed with the support of the Fulbright Program and the National Endowment for the Humanities. As a public scholar, she has advocated for social justice and peace in Korea with Amnesty International USA, Truth Foundation, and Women Cross DMZ.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Asian American and Diaspora Studies"],"location":{"address":"Richard White Lecture Hall, Room 107","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=158"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Law","Asia focus","Multicultural/Identity","Ethics","Human Rights","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Movie/Film","Health/Wellness","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-bdd2b5bf-000041d6demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rmk33"],"series-name":"APSI Speaker Series","presenter":"Deann Borshay Liem (documentarian); Suzy Kim (Rutgers University)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231108/22d95c0d1f1ccbacc9916377b7d9fde7-CR-Crossings_Screening-DC_20231017084808PM.png","image_alt_text":"Still image from a film depicting women holding signs and banners at a protest event; descriptive text (event title, date, time, location, speaker names)"},{"id":"CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-4484f451-00001742demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T00:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T01:30:00Z","summary":"Pitching and Prizes","description":"Pitch for Prizes - tell us what you're working on! 5 minute pitches, win prizes like pint glasses and gift cards.

However, its role in magnetism remains poorly understood. I will discuss surprising experimental observations revealing a crucial role of the electron's orbital moment in ferromagnetism and elucidating a previously unrecognized connection between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity.\n\nOur magnetoelectronic measurements of heterostructures based on ultrathin transition metal ferromagnets revealed two separate magnetic order parameters: one associated with spin ordering at the Curie point Tc1, and another \"anomalous\" order parameter with a critical point Tc2 about 50K above the Curie temperature. Remarkably, magneto-optical measurements are not sensitive to the anomalous contribution, suggesting that the origin of the latter is qualitatively different from spin magnetism. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements show that the \"anomalous\" order parameter is associated with incipient orbital ferromagnetism whose signatures vanish below Tc2 without the onset of ferromagnetic orbital ordering. Electric current applied to micropatterned structures in this regime reveals that orbital magnetism is \"hidden\" but does not disappear below Tc2.\n\nI will show that these anomalous behaviors are captured by a simple Hubbard model of orbital correlations among nearest neighbor sites in an ultrathin ferromagnetic layer, leading to the conclusion that orbital moments form an orbital liquid [2] - a long-range correlated orbital state that lacks ordering due to the geometric orbital frustration, analogous to quantum spin liquids formed by frustrated spins and believed to hold the key to high-temperature superconductivity [3]. In the studied orbital liquid, orbital moments are ferromagnetically coupled, which would be impossible for spin liquid due to spin conservation. I will discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the mechanisms of magnetism and for the emerging field of orbitronics.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Physics","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Physics 298","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=94"},"contact":{"name":"Dina Weberg","email":"dina.weberg@duke.edu"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-62756301-0000024bdemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rlf41"],"series-name":"Condensed Matter Seminar","presenter":"Sergei Urazhdin (Emory University)"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-d5c781d4-00003d49demobedework@mysite.edu_20231109T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T18:00:00Z","summary":"Critical Care Grand Rounds - \"Coagulopathy of acute infections and DIC\"","description":"Critical Care Grand Rounds occurs via Zoom on Thursdays from 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm EST, and is led by Drs.

RNA elements that promote genome selection have been identified, but the determinants of authentic packaging fidelity and efficiency remain unknown. We recently showed that heterogeneous transcriptional start site usage by HIV-1 produces 5′-capped RNAs beginning with one, two, or three 5′-guanosines (Cap1G, Cap2G, Cap3G, respectively) that are either selected for packaging as genomes (Cap1G) or retained in cells as translatable mRNAs (Cap2G/Cap3G). 2H-edited NMR structural studies revealed that the Cap1G transcript adopts a dimeric multi-hairpin structure that sequesters the cap, inhibits interactions with translation initiation factor eIF4E, and resists decapping. In contrast, the Cap2G/Cap3G transcripts adopt an alternate structure with an elongated central helix, exposed splice donor residues, and an accessible cap. Extensive remodeling, achieved at the energetic cost of a G-C base pair, explains how a single 5′ guanosine modifies the function of a ~9 kilobase HIV-1 transcript. Finally, using an NMR-directed competitive packaging approach, we show that cap sequestration is an essential determinant of HIV-1 genome packaging, likely preventing cap-dependent capture by the cellular RNA processing and translation machinery.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering (CBTE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366"},"contact":{"name":"Canning, Jessica","email":"Jessica.Canning@duke.edu","phone":"919-613-1321"},"categories":["Medicine","Engineering","Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-db1468e1-00007187demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jac228"],"series-name":"BioE Seminar Series","presenter":"Michael Summers, PhD","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/f01b5c579d8a0413ad9b84d0347236c6-CR-Summers-cropped_20230911031307PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Michael Summers Headshot"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-aea03251-00000bb4demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T18:15:00Z","summary":"CCDGB: Ayasha Guerin, \"Shoreline Lessons for Relational Repair\"","description":"Please join the Climate Change, Decolonization, and Global Blackness Lab (CCDGB) at the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute for our 2023-24 speaker series.

Brett Ashley Kaplan, Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor for 2023-24, will be visiting Duke University and Carolina and will host this event from the UNC campus.\nKaplan's first public talk with take place at Duke University, at the Nasher Museum of Art on November 8, 2023.\nMemory, History and the Care for the Dead  with Hans Ruin, Södertörn University (Stockholm)\nThe talk takes its point of departure in the book Being with the Dead. Burial, Ancestral Politics, and the Roots of Historical Consciousness (Standford UP, 2019). It reconnects to Michel de Certeau's famous argument that historiography constitutes a cesura regarding the dead, as compared to older cultures of memory that preserve a living relation to the dead. The argument is that this definitive distinction between the work of memory and historiography disregards the deeper liaison between them, and the ways in which historiography can also be interpreted as a kind of sublimated mortuary culture.\nHans Ruin is professor of philosophy, with a PhD from Stockholm university and the co-founder of the philosophy department at Södertörn university. His work spans phenomenology and hermeneutics (Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer), deconstruction (translator of several books by Derrida), Nietzsche (co-director for Nietzsche's collected works in Swedish). For six years, he organized the largest memory-studies research program in Sweden and is currently also a Swedish representative on the board of the Mnemonics Network. His book, on which he will speak, was awarded the INTH prize for best book in the theory of history in 2022.\nBrett Ashley Kaplan received her Ph.D. from the rhetoric department at the University of California, Berkeley in 2002 and is now a professor and Conrad Humanities Scholar in the Program in Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

Previous research has shown that Candida albicans is hypersensitive to copper (Cu) dyshomeostasis in the presence of antifungal drug treatment by the popular triazole fluconazole. This work aims to investigate the ability of metal trafficking inhibitors to alter metal homeostasis in C. albicans. Toward this goal, we identified five compounds with demonstrated metal-trafficking protein inhibition from a literature review. One of the metal trafficking inhibitors tested, the Cu chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), was found by C. albicans growth assays to have antifungal properties, an activity that has not been documented previously . Data from ion-coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed significantly increased intracellular Mo levels, confirming that TTM internalizes into the cell. Utilizing bulk proteomic methods to measure protein stability changes, we found that TTM treatment results in altered stability of metalated proteins such as cytochrome c, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), the flavo-hemoglobin nitric oxide dioxygenase (Yhb1), and the multicopper oxidase Fet31. TTM treatment destabilizes Sod1 and increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden while stabilizing and upregulating the compensatory Yhb1. Upon comparison of TTM's antifungal activity to that of the extracellular Cu chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), we determined that TTM's activity is not due to Cu chelation and subsequent deprivation, as BCS does not inhibit C. albicans growth or impact the metalloproteome stability in the same way. Additionally, inhibiting the upregulated and stabilized Yhb1 during TTM treatment with azole antifungals with known Yhb1 inhibiting capabilities resulted in synergistic antifungal activity as determined by checkerboard growth assays. The combined inhibition of Yhb1 with TTM treatment is a promising antifungal development avenue.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Chemistry","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"FFSC 3225"},"contact":{"name":"De La Cruz, Claudia","email":"claudia.delacruz@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-8472"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-718149bc-000005bademobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cd111"],"presenter":"Katherine McAuliffe, Ph.D. Candidate","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/a19ab3e8ce350b6328059fbf57247d33-CR-GRAD-Mcauliffe,Katherine-11-09-23_20231027021940PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Ph.D. Defense- McAuliffe, Katherine"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd2e0064-0000136edemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T20:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T21:00:00Z","summary":"Duke BME Diversity, Equity \u0026 Inclusion Committee presents “The Meyerhoff Program at UMBC: Successful and replicable approaches for enhancing inclusive excellence in STEM”","description":"Academics across all science, technology, engineering, and related fields with an interest in increasing diversity and access in STEM are invited to hear from Dr. Michael Summers.  \n\nThe Meyerhoff Scholars Program at UMBC is a nationally recognized model for increasing retention and academic performance of URM undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs. Meyerhoff includes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds who are interested in issues of diversity and inclusion in STEM. Since 1993, the program has graduated more than 1500 students, of which more than 426 alumni have earned PhDs, 74 have earned MD-PhDs, 160 have earned MDs, and 330 have earned Master's degrees (some on the way to a PhD). More than 200 additional alumni are currently enrolled in STEM graduate and professional programs. 71 alumni currently hold faculty appointments. Qualified high school students who declined Meyerhoff offers and attended other universities were half as likely to graduate with a STEM degree and approximately 5 times less likely to pursue or complete STEM graduate degrees. Despite being medium sized university with a modest population of African American students (~12,000 undergraduates, 14% African American) UMBC is the top undergraduate school of origin of African American STEM PhD and M.D.-Ph.D. recipients in the U.S. To determine if Meyerhoff like outcomes could be achieved at other Majority research institutions with different URM compositions, geographies, institutional sizes, and cultures, but with like-minded leadership, we established partnerships with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Pennsylvania State University. Five-year outcomes indicate that the program can be adopted at other institutions, with outcomes immediately matching or exceeding the Meyerhoff Program. Approaches that leverage lessons learned from successful programs like Meyerhoff with inter-institutional partnering could serve as a general paradigm for expanding inclusive excellence in STEM.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Biomedical Engineering (BME)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366"},"contact":{"name":"Adams, Happi","email":"happi.adams@duke.edu","phone":"919-724-6458"},"categories":["Diversity/Inclusion","Engineering","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd2e0064-0000136edemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["mha32"],"presenter":"Michael Summers, PhD","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/7ce958822fdb13125a8f5f84bf9dfe36-CR-Duke BME DEI - Michael Summers - Nov 9 - Meyerhoff _20231010012322PM.png","image_alt_text":"The title of the talk and a picture of Dr. Michael Summers against an orange background."},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-3dc51b1b-000022c5demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T20:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T22:00:00Z","summary":"Faculty Service-Learning Reading Group","description":"How do we facilitate student empowerment and agency in times of change? \nLet's meet to explore themes presented in Faculty Service-Learning Guidebook: Enacting Equity-Centered Teaching, Partnerships, and Scholarship.

He was surprised to find foreigners in such a remote area, and even more surprised at what they were selling: women's lingerie.\n\nFor the next two years, Hessler made repeated research trips to Upper Egypt, where he learned that independent Chinese entrepreneurs were selling lingerie in almost every city. Before living in Egypt, Hessler had spent eleven years in China, and this project allowed him to combine his interests and skills in China and Egypt, Mandarin and Arabic. It also allowed him to untangle a mystery: How had entrepreneurs from an obscure part of Zhejiang province found their way to an even more obscure part of Upper Egypt, and how did they decide to focus on this unusual product?\n\nThrough telling the stories of average people, Hessler reveals larger trends in societal upheavals and re-sedimentation. His talk will explore lived realities surrounding China's meteoric rise and Egypt's unanticipated revolution. \n\nDrawing from his in-depth coverage of both regions, Hessler will provide insightful comparisons across histories and cultures while elucidating his singular method of finding the story.\n\nIntro by Prasenjit Duara, Oscar L.

He first went to live in China's Sichuan province as a Peace Corps volunteer, from 1996 to 1998, an experience that became the subject of his first book, \"River Town.\" With Hessler's next two books, \"Oracle Bones\" and \"Country Driving,\" he completed a trilogy of reported works that spanned a decade in China. In 2011, he moved with his family to Cairo, where he lived for five years. His fifth book, \"The Buried,\" described his experiences during the Egyptian Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2019, Hessler returned to China, where he taught for two years at Sichuan University. He also covered the pandemic for The New Yorker, reporting from Wuhan and other cities. This experience is the subject of his newest book, \"Other Rivers,\" which will be published summer 2024. Hessler currently lives in southwestern Colorado with his wife, the writer Leslie T. Chang, and their twin daughters.\n\n**This event is co-sponsored by APSI, DUMESC and AMES with support from the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund**","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Duke University Middle East Studies Center"],"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Library Holsti-Anderson Family Assembly Room 153","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1872"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Law","Climate","Sustainability","Africa focus","China focus","Middle East focus","Asia focus","Ethics","Human Rights","United States Focus","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Global","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-05c7eb19-00003e63demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rmk33"],"presenter":"Peter Hessler (The New Yorker)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/58c056a8316d23a796291b4099649ff5-CR-Hessler_Calendar_20231010122141PM.png","image_alt_text":"Headshot of Peter Hessler; descriptive text on a blue background (title, date, time, location)"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72930768-0000159bdemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T22:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T00:00:00Z","summary":"“Sparking Stewardship”","description":"Following a decade and a half of establishing their international artistic and musical solo careers, Marlena Novak and Jay Alan Yim founded localStyle in 2000 as a platform for collaboration, addressing issues of climate change and extractivism and expanding to focus on non-human others via themes such as the mating behavior of non-binary marine flatworms, the sonification of electric fish, speculative blackbird grammar, the illusory logic underlying human taxonomic systems, and the crisis facing coral reefs, whom they consider the voice of the Anthropocene.

Breakfast is served at 9 am, and the lecture begins promptly at 9:30 am.\n\n\"Epic Errancy: The Renaissance Virago and her Macabre Genealogies\"\n\nA site of intertextual interplay, epic poetry produces genealogical reflections that blur the edges between fiction and history. If it is often the epic project to transform, so as to efface, the perceivable bounds between legend and chronicle, where do figures fall who play no substantial role in epic's dynastic trajectory? This talk turns to one such figure, the virago, to account for her particular set of genealogies-discursive and historical-represented in Italian chivalric romance epic and its reception. My case study concerns the parallel developments in the myths and legends associated with the Ferrarese noblewoman, Marfisa d'Este (1554-1608), and her literary counterpart Marfisa, the female knight from Matteo Maria Boiardo's and Ludovico Ariosto's chivalric epic poetry. Through the Este princess's embrace of her cross-dressed poetic self in courtly performance, alongside the variations of the figure \"Marfisa bizzarra\" (bizarre Marfisa) in Italian mock epic, the intermedial afterlives of these two figures transformed from emblems of exemplarity into nearly unrecognizable icons of demonic decadence. Per the descriptions later offered by tourists Dickens and Goethe, the reconfigurations of utopic-turned-grim Ferrara-the city whose poetry gave birth to both Marfisas-participated in these women's haunting reception from the fifteenth through twenty-first centuries. The inquiries into gender and women's history developed in this study ask to what extent the legacies of Renaissance women have undergone not only category-confounding textual and visual transformations, but grotesque, even macabre misfigurations. \n\nKate Driscoll is Assistant Professor of Italian and Romance Studies at Duke University (Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley).

In this in-person class with Shannon Currey, of Izel Native Plants, learn how to minimize these inputs and create a garden that instead adds ecological benefits while building resilience. This installment in our low-resource landscaping series focuses on native plants for groundcovers. We'll talk about creating a living mulch that competes with weeds, reduces runoff and erosion, and provides support for wildlife. The goal is to add big benefits while reducing inputs. During this classroom session, you'll learn about the strategies plants use to compete and cover ground, discuss species to look for in the winter landscape for inspiration, and work through how to make smart choices in your landscape.

From recent knowledge of the channel, new applications and AI/ML opportunities become clear.  The talk highlights advances in modeling the spatial and temporal nature of radio channels, including the impact of antenna patterns and received signal envelopes of received signals, thereby offering insights into phenomena that can be used in learning models for artificial intelligence (AI) to predict signal behavior in real-world channels. Special emphasis is given to the relatively new Two-Wave With Diffuse Power (TWDP) distribution that encompasses Raleigh and Rician fading as special cases, and repeatable measured phenomenon of diffraction effects when a receiver  encounters an object that physically begins to block a radio path. New approaches that learn the directions of arrivals and the extent of multipath from simple narrowband envelope measurements, and how to optimize and learn channel behaviors from ray tracing are also presented, thus offering insights into promising ML/AI approaches to physical layer prediction and learning.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Hudson Hall 125","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=101"},"contact":{"name":"Rice, Cynthia","email":"cynthia.rice@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-5252"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-9a1f6333-00003368demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cpr24"],"presenter":"Theodore Rappaport","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/864f28a3c9f25811e944c690d372aa23-CR-Theodore Rappaport_20230927033158PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"THEODORE RAPPAPORT"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-6dcb6e7b-00006665demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-10T19:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T20:30:00Z","summary":"Climate Migration \u0026 Food Security","description":"Join us for a thought-provoking panel event that delves into the critical intersection of climate migration and food policy, presented by the Program on Climate-Related Migration (PCRM), the Duke Center for International Development (DCID), and the South-North Scholars (SNS).

He was the founding lead guitarist of the seminal Chinese heavy metal band Tang Dynasty and continued to be active in rock music in China until 2016. After several years as a reporter covering tech and society in China in the 2000s, he joined Baidu, China's leading search engine, as director of international communications. Since 2016, when The China Project acquired the Sinica Podcast, he has served as Head of Podcasts and edits and produces several podcasts under The China Project. He lives in Chapel Hill but is neutral when it comes to basketball allegiances.\n\n--Peter Hessler--\nSince 2000, Peter Hessler has been a staff writer at The New Yorker. He first went to live in China's Sichuan province as a Peace Corps volunteer, from 1996 to 1998, an experience that became the subject of his first book, \"River Town.\" With Hessler's next two books, \"Oracle Bones\" and \"Country Driving,\" he completed a trilogy of reported works that spanned a decade in China. In 2011, he moved with his family to Cairo, where he lived for five years. His fifth book, \"The Buried,\" described his experiences during the Egyptian Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2019, Hessler returned to China, where he taught for two years at Sichuan University. He also covered the pandemic for The New Yorker, reporting from Wuhan and other cities. This experience is the subject of his newest book, \"Other Rivers,\" which will be published summer 2024.

Told in flashback as the artist (Nigel Terry) lies dying in poverty, the film brilliantly recreates the look and color of Caravaggio's original paintings while exploring the homoerotic subtext of his work. Speculating on the artist's relationship with his model Ranuccio (Sean Bean), the film explores a vicious love triangle involving the model's wife, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton in her first feature role.

Due to the limited sample size and patient heterogeneity, the characteristics of patients in new phase II trials often differ from those in the selected historical controls, leading to potential false positive or false negative conclusions. Randomized phase II trials offer a solution by randomizing patients between an experimental arm and a control arm.\nIn this dissertation, we seek efficient designs for multi-stage randomized clinical trials and develop inference methods for the widely used odds ratio parameter. We propose a two-stage randomized phase II trial design based on Fisher's exact tests. This design includes options for early stopping due to either superiority or futility, aimed at optimizing patient enrollment whether the experimental therapy proves efficacious or not. Furthermore, we introduce a novel criterion, the weighted expected sample size, to define optimal designs for multi-stage clinical trials. We have also developed a Java software tool capable of identifying these optimal designs. Additionally, we present a bias-corrected estimator and an exact conditional confidence interval for the odds ratio in multi-stage randomized clinical trials.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB)","co_sponsors":["Biostatistics and Bioinformatics","School of Medicine (SOM)"],"location":{"address":"Hock Plaza 214"},"contact":{"name":"Allison, Tasha","email":"tasha.allison@duke.edu","phone":"919-668-6735"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-3dcfba70-00004f78demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["allis010"],"series-name":"B\u0026B Dissertation Defense","presenter":"Shiwei Cao","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231113/d942e27831b80becab861127460f8509-CR-Shiwei_Cao-image_20231017012341PM.png","image_alt_text":"Shiwei Cao"},{"id":"CAL-8a0183a7-83184018-0184-3468c9cb-000021c5demobedework@mysite.edu_20231113T140000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-13T14:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-13T18:00:00Z","summary":"Communicating with Diplomacy \u0026 Tact II","description":"\u003cb\u003eFor employees of Duke University and DUHS\u003c/b\u003e \n\u003cb\u003eContinuing Education Credits (CEUs):\u003c/b\u003e 0.3 \n\n\u003cb\u003ePRE-REQUISITE:\u003c/b\u003e Please note that you must have successfully completed Communicating with Diplomacy \u0026 Tact 1 prior to attending this course.

Violence, overcrowding, infrastructural decrepitude, and corruption all limit possibilities for dignified life behind bars. Given the incapacity or unwillingness of the Colombian state to fulfill its legal obligations to the incarcerated population, prisoners rely on family members and loved ones for everything from basic toiletries to emotional support to political advocacy. For incarcerated trans people, the need for care is especially acute. Although Colombia's legal regime provides trans people with rights and benefits that nominally ensure them access to such necessities as healthcare, intimacy, gender identity documentation, and social recognition, in practice, they are systematically abandoned to fend for themselves in conditions of precarious neglect, to fight to make flimsy legal guarantees into concrete reality. In this paper, I ask who performs the work to care for trans people behind bars, what form this care takes, and how it can help us to understand the (trans)feminization of care labor, the relationship between love and obligation in conditions of confinement, and how chosen communities of currently- and formerly-incarcerated trans people cohere through practices of mutual aid and advocacy. I draw on ongoing ethnographic fieldwork with the Red Comunitaria Trans [Communitarian Trans Network], in particular the \"Cuerpos en Prisión, Mentes en Acción\" [Bodies in Prison, Minds in Action] working group, as well as my role as an embedded \"pasante de investigación\" [research intern] with the Grupo de Prisiones [Prison Group] legal clinic at the elite University of the Andes School of Law. \n\nBio: Joe Hiller is a PhD candidate in the Department of Cultural Anthropology, Duke University, with a Certificate in Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies, and a research intern at the Grupo de Prisiones Clínica Jurídica, Facultad de Derecho, Universidad de los Andes.

While the underlying basis for this increase in susceptibility is not known, many reports have indicated that it is due to quantitative and qualitative differences in neonatal T lymphocytes.  We believe these differences arise from altered programs of T cell production and maintenance during early stages of development.  In early life, there is a greater proportion of immature recent thymic emigrants, more extensive homeostatic proliferation of naïve T cells, different hematopoietic precursors, and a smaller repertoire of T cells.  We are currently using neonatal mouse models of infectious diseases to determine the relative contribution of these differences toward impaired adaptive immune responses.  The goal of my research is to identify the most critical primary defects in neonatal T cells, as well as to uncover the mechanisms that underlie such defects.  Knowledge gained from these studies will then be used to design more effective therapeutic interventions and vaccines that can be safely administered in early life. \n\nhttps://duke.zoom.us/j/98145597137","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Immunology","co_sponsors":["Duke Integrative Immunobiology"],"location":{"address":"Jones 143","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=50"},"contact":{"name":"Fabean, Brooke","email":"brooke.fabean@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-2998"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-408f9530-00002b9fdemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["bnf13"],"series-name":"Immunology Seminar Series","presenter":"Brian Rudd, MPH, PhD","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231114/327f834956857f460f6cf5c4fd1040c4-CR-Calendar-Image-Sept5-2023_20230905034504PM.png","image_alt_text":"IMMSeminarSeries"},{"id":"CAL-8a0183a7-83184018-0183-32e0c136-00006bd7demobedework@mysite.edu_20231114T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-14T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-14T19:00:00Z","summary":"Academic Advising Center Drop-in Advising","description":"Drop by the AAC with quick advising questions or to get additional input on your academic plans.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Academic Advising Center (AAC)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Academic Advising Center","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=172"},"contact":{"name":"Hoff, Jen","email":"jen.hoff@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-2054"},"categories":["Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0183a7-83184018-0183-32e0c136-00006bd7demobedework@mysite.edu_20231114T170000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jdh106"],"webcast-url":"https://advising.duke.edu","image_alt_text":"Picture of exterior of Academic Advising Center building on East Campus"},{"id":"CAL-8a039357-8a8ece25-018a-8fcb4a71-00001804demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-14T17:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-14T18:30:00Z","summary":"Evolving moldy murderers: Aspergillus as a model for studying the repeated evolution of opportunistic pathogenicity","description":"Antonis Rokas, Vanderbilt, Department of Biological Sciences","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"University Program in Genetics \u0026 Genomics (UPGG)","co_sponsors":["School of Medicine (SOM)"],"location":{"address":"Nanaline Duke 147","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=69"},"contact":{"name":"Shipp, Amanda","email":"amanda.shipp@duke.edu","phone":"660-4300"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a039357-8a8ece25-018a-8fcb4a71-00001804demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["agn10"],"series-name":"Tuesday Seminar Series","presenter":"Antonis Rokas","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231114/97d47df3909c339fe66b4dfae5a11da2-CR-Rokas UPG  _20230913062619PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Rokus"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5ca1622a-000035dfdemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-14T17:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-14T21:30:00Z","summary":"Reimagining our Shared Approach to Fall Respiratory Virus Seasons: New Strategies for Transmission Reduction and Population-Level Benefit","description":"Respiratory viruses continue to present a burden for the United States, despite the advancement of medical products that effectively prevent or mitigate severe illness, hospitalization, and death.

This comes from the difficulty of putting a chiral gauge theory on the lattice. One of the important developments motivated by this question is the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation, which encodes how the anomalous chiral symmetry \"optimally\" manifests on the lattice. \n \nOn the other hand, developments in condensed-matter have uncovered a deep connection between anomalies and topological insulators/superconductors. At the boundary of such topological materials, you can have massless fermions with an anomalous symmetry. Domain-wall fermions used in lattice QCD simulations can be understood as a special case of this. Since domain-wall fermions are a solution to the GW equation, one may wonder -- can the GW relation and its solutions be generalized to other topological insulators and superconductors?\n \nIn this talk, we will review the story of chiral fermions on the lattice and the importance of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We will then discuss how it can be generalized to boundary theories of various classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Interestingly, perturbative and even some global anomalies (à la Witten) show up in this formalism in an elementary fashion from the Jacobian of the fermionic measure.\n \nBased on https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08542.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Physics","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Physics 298","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=94"},"contact":{"name":"None"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-a95cf9fc-00003180demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rlf41"],"series-name":"Triangle Nuclear Theory Colloquium","presenter":"Hersh Singh"},{"id":"CAL-8a039357-8a8ece25-018a-8f55cab2-00000eb6demobedework@mysite.edu_20231114T210000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-14T21:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-14T22:00:00Z","summary":"Global Conversations in the Wellness Center","description":"Join our English conversation gatherings on Tuesday afternoons!

Social discrimination against Coptic Christians, for example, has increased since the regime transition after the 2011 Arab uprisings. What do daily inter-sectarian relations look like in Christians' everyday lives? How do social class, gender, and geography shape discrimination based on religion differently? And what are the functions of religion beyond the church walls in the face of social discrimination? Drawing from ethnographic data collected in Cairo, Egypt between 2014 and 2018, this research suggests a novel approach of \"living sectarianism\" to the study of sectarianism in the Middle East and North Africa. The existing studies on this topic have largely focused on a structuralist analysis, such as historical changes in relations among the state, Islamist power, and the Church. While this is an important contribution to showing how sectarianism is constructed by major political and religious institutions, it leaves out the experiences of ordinary Egyptians. Combining the theoretical and methodological frameworks of lived religion and intersectionality, this approach reveals lesser-known aspects of the daily lives of Copts as religious minorities in Egypt. Lived religion teaches us how religion helps Christians define or reframe their discriminatory experiences, and the intersectionality of class, gender, and geography offers a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of sectarianism, without homogenizing Christians.\n\nAs a political sociologist, Prof. Ha studies how macro-level power structures shape sectarian boundaries among ethnic and religious groups and how minorities make sense of their identities and status in turn. Her current research examines sectarian interactions between Egyptian Christians and Muslims with an intersectional lens to understand how in the post-Arab Uprisings Christian minorities' daily interactions unfold differently based on their gender, social class, and geography. This research provides an analysis of the lived experience of minorities in the contemporary Middle East, which advances the literature of sectarianism that has mainly focused on structural analysis of political actors, such as the state and Islamist groups. \n\nQuestions: griffin.orlando@duke.edu","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke University Middle East Studies Center","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"None"},"contact":{"name":"Orlando, Griffin","email":"griffin.orlando@duke.edu","phone":"919-668-1653"},"categories":["Middle East focus","Global","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-f0f91608-00002a67demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://duke.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtdOGtqj0uHNyOTt5gs0CTP-bWtrqVtRGj","submitted_by":["bgo3"],"webcast-url":"https://duke.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUtdOGtqj0uHNyOTt5gs0CTP-bWtrqVtRGj","presenter":"Hyun Jeong Ha (DKU)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231115/b5e445c69fde4b0728a9748cb2975a9e-CR-duke calendar - hyun jeong ha_20231002031930PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"flyer with image of Professor Hyun Gong Ha"},{"id":"CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97b90fac-00000de2demobedework@mysite.edu_20231115T150000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-15T15:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:00:00Z","summary":"Academic Advising Center Drop-in Advising","description":"Drop by the AAC with quick advising questions or to get additional input on your academic plans.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Academic Advising Center (AAC)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Academic Advising Center","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=172"},"contact":{"name":"Hoff, Jen","email":"jen.hoff@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-2054"},"categories":["Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97b90fac-00000de2demobedework@mysite.edu_20231115T150000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jdh106"],"webcast-url":"https://advising.duke.edu/"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72ba22e0-00001700demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-15T15:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:00:00Z","summary":"Employment Authorization Options for F-1 and J-1 Students","description":"Employment Authorization Presentation\nOn November 15, 2023, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, Duke Visa Services will host a Zoom presentation to provide employment authorization information to Duke University F-1 and J-1 degree seeking students for Optional Practical Training, Curricular Practical Training and Academic Training for summer internships and employment after graduation.\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n \nhttps://duke.zoom.us/j/95956853661?pwd=amFMUEk4c1phWEp5Qkh1M2tlekJIQT09\u0026from=addon \n\n959 5685 3661\n798066\n\nhttps://visaservices.duke.edu/visa-categories/f-1/f-1-curricular-practical-training-cpt/\nhttps://visaservices.duke.edu/visa-categories/f-1/f-1-optional-practical-training-opt/ \nhttps://visaservices.duke.edu/visa-categories/j-1/academic-training-students-j-1-status/\n \nNote that there is also a detailed PowerPoint presentation at:\nhttps://duke.app.box.com/s/86yunbjnpvogu41q36wfm6ureqqi7qe5\n\nWe hope you will attend.\n \nRegards\nDuke Visa Services","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Visa Services","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Zoom Meeting","link":" https://duke.zoom.us/j/95956853661?pwd=amFMUEk4c1phWEp5Qkh1M2tlekJIQT09\u0026amp;from=addon "},"contact":{"name":"Wagstaff, Janet","email":"janet.williams@duke.edu","phone":"919-684-5654"},"categories":["Information Session"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72ba22e0-00001700demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["willi154"]},{"id":"CAL-8a018db2-8a941eb2-018a-95116ab2-00000bd8demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-15T16:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:40:00Z","summary":"Ecological aesthetics: visual archives of transformation in the artwork of Marjan Baniasadi and Maryam Baniasadi","description":"This event investigates aesthetic archival practices between Iran and Pakistan and their entanglements with political ecologies.

Marjan and Maryam are twin sisters and have developed distinct aesthetics during their training at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan. Marjan specializes in painting and ceramics; Maryam in contemporary miniature painting. Both explore social, biological and material transformation in urban ecologies in their work. In conversation with Negar Mottahedeh (Duke University) and Salima Hashmi (Beaconhouse National University, Lahore) Marjan and Maryam discuss through their artworks the interface between fictive and non-fictive life, injury and death.

These materials exhibit phase transitions, changes in solubility, and nanoscale mechanical alterations triggered by external stimuli, particularly light, through molecular-level structural changes. While the photo-switching of molecules has primarily been studied in dilute solutions, understanding this process in condensed liquid or solid environments is crucial for successful real-world applications. Currently, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge regarding the interaction between light and molecules in condensed phases, as well as the impact of photomechanical switching on intermolecular interactions.\n\nThis presentation aims to elucidate the design principles behind optically-controllable materials that integrate organic photoswitches, ranging from azobenzenes to hydrazones. Extensive exploration of various photochromic core structures and functional groups has been conducted to gain insights into the structure-property relationship of these stimuli-responsive material systems. Additionally, the talk will delve into the application of photo-controlled materials in solar photon and thermal energy storage, as well as sustainable catalysis.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Materials Initiative","co_sponsors":["Biology","Biomedical Engineering (BME)","Chemistry","Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)","Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics (FIP)","Mathematics","Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS)","Physics","Pratt School of Engineering"],"location":{"address":"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side A, room 1464","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98"},"contact":{"name":"Liana Igescu","email":"liana.igescu@duke.edu"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-1fd22280-000014c3demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["lmi3"],"presenter":"Grace Han","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231115/8c3781c3d6cc4a150570000fa1040241-CR-Untitled design (3)_20231011053906PM.png","image_alt_text":"Speaker Headshot"},{"id":"CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-4a8b333d-0000684ademobedework@mysite.edu_20231115T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-15T18:00:00Z","summary":"In vitro and in vivo engineering of focal amplifications mediated by ecDNAs","description":"Regulatory Networks in Health and Disease is the Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology seminar series held each Wednesday at 12:00 noon in 143 Jones (unless otherwise indicated).\n*** Continuing Education credits will be available.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Pharmacology and Cancer Biology","co_sponsors":["School of Medicine (SOM)"],"location":{"address":"Jones 143","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=50"},"contact":{"name":"Martelon, Trena","email":"trena.martelon@duke.edu"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-4a8b333d-0000684ademobedework@mysite.edu_20231115T170000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["marte006"],"series-name":"PCB Seminar Series","presenter":"Andrea Ventura, MD, PhD, MSKCC","image_alt_text":"Andrea Ventura"},{"id":"CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-3ad556f4-0000409ademobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-15T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-15T18:00:00Z","summary":"Remembering Maltheus Avery: Race, Medicine, and Duke Hospital in the Jim Crow Era","description":"On December 1, 1950, a 24 year old Army veteran named Maltheus Avery died from a car accident after having been turned away from Duke Hospital--because its wards for Black patients were full.

Using a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and models, including decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, Chi-Squared Test, mutual information, KModes clustering, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique, we analyzed mental health survey data from the University of Michigan Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research. Our objective was to investigate the connections between COVID-19-related adverse effects and shifts in alcohol consumption habits among healthcare workers. Our analysis of the supervised and unsupervised methods revealed that healthcare workers who had children at home during the first wave of the pandemic in the US consumed more alcohol. We also found that changes in work schedules due to the COVID-19 pandemic were linked to alterations in alcohol use habits. Additional factors, such as changes in food consumption, age, gender, geographical characteristics, changes in sleep habits, news consumption volume, and screen time, also significantly predicted increased alcohol use among healthcare workers in the United States.\n \nInstructors Biosketch\nDr. Mostafa Rezapour is currently a Research Fellow at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.

CCDGB is part of The Entanglement Project, an FHI initiative focused on the intersections of race, health, and climate.\n\nMost talks are hybrid:\n- In-person registration (w/ COVID safety info): https://duke.is/yc4gm\n- Zoom registration: https://duke.is/c/tjhj \n\nThe entangled forces of climate change and decolonization have put institutional knowledge-making apparatuses into interesting states of crisis that call forth creativity and experimentation, even as they invoke uncertainty and fear. As planetarity displaces globality, \"post-humanist\" thought seeks to remake western imaginations through concepts that dissolve familiar hierarchies of scale and familiar divides between animate/inanimate and living/nonliving. Simultaneously, the new millennium has inaugurated a worldwide flourishing of indigenous thought that proposes to remake the intellectual commons along decolonial and anti-extractivist lines. Territoriality sits at the heart of much of this revolutionary intellectual work, even as multispecies migration appears as a central axis of the planet's unfolding story.\n\nMary Louise Pratt is Silver Professor (emerita) in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures and the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University, where she taught Latin American literature and culture, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, and theory. She was formerly the Olive H. Palmer Professor of Humanities at Stanford University, where she was a leading voice in debates over humanities education, multiculturalism, and social justice. Dr. Pratt is affiliated with NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and the Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics. Her current research interests include language, globalization and empire, mythologies of modernity, indigeneity as a global force, and the challenge of environmental catastrophe. Her publications include Toward a Speech Act Theory of Literary Discourse 1979); Women, Culture and Politics in Latin America (1993 co-authored); Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation. (1992, 2007);  Los imaginarios planetarios (2017), and Planetary Longings (2022).

Marbrey received her PhD studying how progesterone signaling regulates embryo implantation in a spatiotemporal manner. Dr. Marbrey then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine with Dr. Kathleen Caron discerning effects of toxicants, environmental exposures, and tobacco products on pregnancy health, timing, and disease. Dr. Marbrey was the first to report on the consequences of e-cigarette use during an in vivo pregnancy, specifically how e-cigarettes can elicit delays in implantation and cause chronic metabolic consequences in exposed offspring. Her work was published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society and earmarked as one of the top breakthrough discoveries in endocrine science of 2019 by Endocrine News. The article was reported by multiple news outlets including Vice, Bustle, Med India, Business Insider, and Yahoo Finance and many more. Dr. Marbrey started an Assistant Professor position in the Department of Obstetrics \u0026 Gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine in February of 2023 and is continuing her studies on e-cigarettes and reproductive biology to assess public health risk and improve patient care in reproductive health.\n\nTHIS IS A HYBRID SEMINAR WITH IN-PERSON \u0026 REMOTE ATTENDANCE OPTIONS.\n\nThis seminar will be held in Field Auditorium (room 1112), Grainger Hall.\nVisit the seminar website for a livestream link to tune in virtually.\nBoth attendance options (in person and virtual) are free and open to all.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Integrated Toxicology \u0026 Environmental Health (ITEHP)","co_sponsors":["Nicholas School of the Environment"],"location":{"address":"Field Auditorium, Grainger Hall, room 1112","link":"https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=52a349af-4e63-4812-83e6-b0530136ae8f   "},"contact":{"name":"Straehle, Jessica","email":"jessica.straehle@duke.edu","phone":"919-613-8078"},"categories":["Medicine","Natural Sciences","Health/Wellness","Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-bd2179b7-00003934demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/envhealth/november-17-2023-e-cigarettes-pregnancy-new-flavor-of-the-same-story/","submitted_by":["jls265"],"series-name":"Integrated Toxicology \u0026 Environmental Health Seminar Series","presenter":"Margeaux Marbrey, PhD, Duke University","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231117/d495f57766f353a0d906945cb157eb64-CR-PhotoMarbrey2023_20230922014321PM.png","image_alt_text":"Seminar Speaker, Dr. Marbrey"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-23c67589-00001b91demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-17T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-17T17:00:00Z","summary":"Ciompi Quartet Lunchtime Classics with Patrick Yim, violist","description":"In this free noontime event, the Ciompi Quartet will perform Johannes Brahms' String Quintet #2 in G Major, Op. 111 with guest violist Patrick Yim. \n\nPraised for his \"deeply expressive, finely nuanced playing\" (Strad Magazine) and \"superb performances\" (Fanfare), Patrick Yim made his solo debut with the Honolulu Symphony and has performed chamber music with Juilliard, Emerson, St. Lawrence, Pacifica, and Ying Quartet members, and musicians from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Cleveland Orchestra, and New York Philharmonic. \n\nSince its founding in 1965 by the renowned Italian violinist Giorgio Ciompi, the Ciompi Quartet of Duke University has delighted audiences and impressed critics around the world.

We propose to infer the conditional dependency structure among EHR features via a latent graphical block model (LGBM).The LGBM has a two layer structure with the first providing semantic embedding vector(SEV) representation for the EHR features and the second overlaying a graphical block model on the latent SEVs. The block structures on the graphical model also allows us tocluster synonymous features in EHR. We propose to learn the LGBM efficiently, in both statistical and computational sense, based on the empirical point mutual information matrix. We establish the statistical rates of the proposed estimators and show the perfect recovery of the block structure. Numerical results from simulation studies and real EHR data analyses suggest that the proposed LGBM estimator performs well in finite sample.\n\nBio:  Junwei Lu is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

It argues that the reputation Aristotle has gained as an arch-misogynist was formulated in the responses to misogynist appeals to Aristotle, but that in feminist contributions to the Querelle des femmes we also find appeals to his biology for the claim that women are superior in virtue of their physiology.  In addition, the paper aims to show that the reception of the biology in these works is moralizing:  the structures and physiology of the bodies of men and women are held to have moral value and to produce inferior or superior intellectual and moral qualities.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Philosophy","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"West Duke 202","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=156"},"contact":{"name":"Gilbert, Rachel","email":"rachel.gilbert@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-3050"},"categories":["Ethics","Human Rights","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Humanities","Natural Sciences","Social Sciences","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-2a925d39-00000cb3demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["esb54"],"presenter":"Marguerite Deslauriers","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231117/e9bfd64d6bb22d2c75c382e1d353ef8c-CR-Margueritte.Deslauriers.dukeFlyer_20231013074413PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Marguerite Deslauries, the speaker, smiling"},{"id":"CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-4e66ce0d-00006cb1demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-17T20:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-17T21:30:00Z","summary":"Leveraging AI Tools in Your Search","description":"This workshop will guide you through the dynamic landscape of AI-powered job seeking, equipping you with practical skills to enhance your search materials and process.

The Bach Cantata Series presents these musical masterpieces accompanied by other notable choral and instrumental works of the Baroque era. This concert presents these two cantatas:\n\n* Ich elender Mensch, wer wird mich erlösen (Wretched being, who will restore me), BWV 48\n\n* Wachet! betet! betet! wachet! (Watch! Pray! Pray! Watch!), BWV 70\n\nThere is no charge for admission. Paid parking is available on a first-come-first-served basis in the Bryan Center Garage at 125 Science Drive. ADA parking is available in the surface lot at the same address.\n\nComposed as part of Bach's first cantata cycle of 1723, Cantata 48 combines the Apostle Paul's exhortation to the Romans to live more truthful lives with the story of Jesus's cure of the paralyzed man. Cantata 70 takes the topic of the \"Second Advent\" and exhorts us to look for a new heaven and a new earth.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Chapel","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Duke Chapel","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=290"},"contact":{"name":"Duke Chapel Music","email":"chapelmusic@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music","Religious/Spiritual"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-1f06ddcc-00006caddemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jtodd"],"series-name":"Bach Cantata Series","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231119/8439b3dcc49dfc0f5a2e7df8df61883b-CR-Bach-Cantata_web1000_20230822085547PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Bach Cantata Series"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-59057ed3-000017d3demobedework@mysite.edu_20231119T220000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-19T22:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","summary":"Eucharist @ Episcopal Center","description":"An Episcopal church service with student-lead and campus minister-lead segments.

During their complex life cycles, apicomplexan parasites coordinate the function of specific proteins to evade the host immune system and thrive under stressful conditions. Currently, these protists are underexplored for biosynthetic potential, however research points to this kingdom as an untapped source for new chemical space. In this defense, I will present work toward understanding polyketide synthase (PKS) genes within Toxoplasma gondii through 1) sequence elucidation and initial domain characterization of a novel T. gondii PKS, TgPKS2, 2) uncovering an unprecedented self-acylation activity within specific carrier proteins in this synthase, and 3) exploring the unusual chain release mechanism present in this system. First, I will investigate the architecture and show our initial studies on TgPKS2 including hydrolysis activities of acyltransferase (AT) domains, mutagenesis studies, and a first of its kind self-acylation activity of acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains in a modular type I PKS. Next, I will emphasize the unique attributes of TgPKS2 by comparing its transacylation activity to well-characterized bacterial and fungal systems. Lastly, I will share our exploration into a never before characterized chain release mechanism present in this synthase, and explore the likely importance of this synthase in parasite biology. Combined, this work encompasses our efforts to characterize TgPKS2, discover the role it plays within the T. gondii life cycle, and elucidate the metabolite(s) produced.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Chemistry","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"FFSC 3225"},"contact":{"name":"De La Cruz, Claudia","email":"claudia.delacruz@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-8472"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-61a92145-0000772ademobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cd111"],"presenter":"Aaron Keeler, Ph.D. Candidate","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231121/30df5bf540a210cc24003843baa21562-CR-GRAD-Keeler,Aaron_11-21-23_20231024122915PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Ph.D. Defense- Keeler, Aaron"},{"id":"CAL-8a0183a7-83184018-0183-32e0c136-00006bd7demobedework@mysite.edu_20231121T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-21T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-21T19:00:00Z","summary":"Academic Advising Center Drop-in Advising","description":"Drop by the AAC with quick advising questions or to get additional input on your academic plans.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Academic Advising Center (AAC)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Academic Advising Center","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=172"},"contact":{"name":"Hoff, Jen","email":"jen.hoff@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-2054"},"categories":["Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0183a7-83184018-0183-32e0c136-00006bd7demobedework@mysite.edu_20231121T170000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jdh106"],"webcast-url":"https://advising.duke.edu","image_alt_text":"Picture of exterior of Academic Advising Center building on East Campus"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-bbf89a9b-00001779demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-21T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-21T18:00:00Z","summary":"Ruth K.

Manufacturing produces and supplies the goods and services needed by society and is an engine of prosperity.  However, like many other aspects of engineering, fundamental changes are needed to manufacturing to put us on a course to being environmentally sustainable. The origins of environmentally responsible manufacturing (often referred to as sustainable manufacturing) will be discussed. In particular, work related to reducing cutting fluids in machining operations, remanufacturing, and economic and environmental evaluation of life cycles will be reviewed. Promising directions for future research and development will also be provided such as circular economy, greener processes and products, smart/sustainable manufacturing, critical material challenges for clean energy technologies, and green manufacturing planning.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side A, room 1464","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98"},"contact":{"name":"Hinz, Nicolle","email":"nicolle.hinz@duke.edu","phone":"832-279-0092"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-1506bd16-00001a24demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"http://cee.duke.edu","submitted_by":["nh143"],"series-name":"CEE Fall Seminar Series 2023","presenter":"John W.

Rao, PhD, Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Florida. Title: \"A Novel Computational Framework for the Numerical Solution of Complex Constrained Optimal Control Problems.\" Abstract: A novel computational framework is described for solving complex constrained nonlinear optimal control problems. The framework has a wide variety of applications in aerospace and mechanical engineering. The basis of the framework is the new class of hp-adaptive Gaussian quadrature methods that transcribe the continuous optimal control problem to a finite-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem. The hp-adaptive methods have the feature that high accuracy can be obtained with a significantly smaller mesh when compared with traditional fixed-order methods while accurately capturing nonsmoothness or rapidly changing behavior. The hp-adaptive methods employed using advanced sparse nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers. The derivatives required by the NLP solvers are obtained using a new approach to algorithmic differentiation where efficient derivative source code is produced through a method that combines operator overloading with source transformation. The mathematical foundation of the framework is provided and examples are given that demonstrate the improvement over previously developed approaches. Finally, future directions of the approach are discussed.\n\nANIL V. Rao (BS, mechanical engineering, Cornell; AB, mathematics with distinction, Cornell; MSE, aerospace engineering, Univ. of Michigan; MA \u0026 PhD, Princeton. After earning his PhD, Dr. Rao joined The Aerospace Corp. in Los Angeles. Subsequently, he was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at The Charles Stark Draper Lab. in Cambridge, MA. While at  Draper, from 2001 to 2006, he was an adjunct faculty in the Dept. of Aerospace \u0026 Mechanical Engineering at Boston Univ. where he taught the core undergrad dynamics course. Since 2006 he has been on faculty in the Dept. of Mechanical \u0026 Aerospace Engineering at the Univ. of Florida, where he is a Professor and the Director of the Vehicle Dynamics and Optimization Lab.

This has to begin in a rebellion that is at once intellectual and spiritual.\" Roberto Unger\nIn this uninterrupted, six-hour experimental and performative symposium from choreographer Michael Kliën, audiences come-and-go as 15 invited guests speak together, drawing from disparate fields of knowledge and free associations to create a matrix of collective thought. Visions toward an equitable survival of the species will emerge in the black box von der Heyden Studio Theater. Connotating the qualities of an oracle, and drawing from contrasting areas of study, free associations, and dreams, 15 panelists will collide and enmesh their ideas into one collective. Together, they will unearth strategies, sensibilities, and visions that are equally potent, poetic, and personal. The audience, free to arrive or leave at any time, is invited to listen and observe this unfolding choreographic thought process and contribute as the situation emerges.\n\nThis work draws from established communicational practices such as Raw Thinking Matrix (Valk), Social Dreaming (Lawrence), Personal Cosmologies, and Parliament (Kliën). It is part of a new project: \"11th Organ: Equipping the Imagination for the Project of Social Reconstruction\"\n\n11th Organ is an open matrix of intellectuals, artists, and concerned citizens dedicated to fundamentally reimagining our wounded world. The 11th Organ engages a poetics of relations, an intimate weaving of diverse minds to churn the psychic soil.

Our solution to this problem is \"Engineered Living Materials\", materials in which biological organisms are embedded within traditional plastic materials. The biological component is programmed to carry out a complex function, in this case, environmental remediation. Two projects will be described here: 1) using cyanobacteria as a source for pollutant decontamination and 2) embedding bacterial spores in plastics as a catalyst for biodegradation. In the first project, we program the cyanobacteria to express a laccase enzyme that is a degrader of common organic pollutants. The cyanobacteria are then embedded in a hydrogel allowing them to filter and clean the water from the pollutant. The second project uses evolution to make spore forming bacteria amenable to polymer melt processing for incorporation into thermoplastic polyurethanes. These bacteria can germinate and then biodegrade the polymer at of the plastics' life cycle. These two projects demonstrate the beauty of repackaging natural biosynthetic functions to improve the environment.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Materials Initiative","co_sponsors":["Biology","Biomedical Engineering (BME)","Chemistry","Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)","Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics (FIP)","Mathematics","Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS)","Physics","Pratt School of Engineering"],"location":{"address":"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side A, room 1464","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98"},"contact":{"name":"Liana Igescu","email":"liana.igescu@duke.edu"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72909998-00001599demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["lmi3"],"presenter":"Jon Pokorski","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231206/cd987e39bf1d32773d6e8e27e9ce8b98-CR-Duke Calendar_20231027071600PM.png","image_alt_text":"Pokorski Headshot"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-67a82516-00003078demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-12-06T17:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-12-06T18:00:00Z","summary":"LIVE: How Can Companies Protect Themselves from Low-Quality Suppliers","description":"Companies who are uncertain about the quality of their suppliers should be careful about engaging in a race to the cheapest bid.

Among their various efforts to continue ethnic education rooted in decolonizing theory and praxis, this presentation examines what I call the \"triangular collaboration\" where Korean residents in Japan, Japanese citizens and South Korean supporters came together to hold a charity concert in Hiroshima in August 2014. Under South Korea's National Security Law (1948~current) which prohibits its citizens from \"contacting North Korean residents,\" it has been challenging for South Koreans to interact with the members of the Korean school community as they can be defined as \"North Koreans.\" In the triangular collaboration, the Japanese civic groups played a crucial role in creating the space and means for a rare diasporic encounter by easing tensions involving the two Korea states. The space of temporal reunification enabled Koreans in Japan to (re)claim material, emotional and ideological ties with their homeland(s) as diasporic subjects and assert their full membership as ethnic minorities in Japan simultaneously. This event not only promoted ethnic minority rights to education but also resisted the forceful erasure of histories and memories of Koreans in Japan that directly speak to Japan's imperial past, the unending Korean War and escalating anti-Korean racism and hate.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nKyung Hee Ha is an assistant professor in the Department of World Languages and Cultures at North Carolina State University.

One of the first vocal ensembles inducted into Gramophone's \"Hall of Fame,\" the King's Singers are famous across the world for their unique blend of the English choral tradition, popular music, modern composition, and a variety of other genres, resulting in a sound that defies easy categorization. Their performances bring matchless technique and endearing engagement with audiences, skills honed across their 55 years as an ensemble.\n\nThe King's Singers' Holiday Program emerges naturally from their conviction that music has the power to unite people and communities, providing a chance for disparate groups to come together in song and fellowship. Their program features Christmas favorites, and also highlights the legacy of English Renaissance composer William Byrd, and explores the works of Scandinavian composers like Norway's Ola Gjeilo. They conclude by offering a convivial jaunt through the magical holiday legacy of Disney music.\n\nThis event is part of our Vocal Ensemble Series. Subscriptions are on sale now for the full series.

Reception to follow. \n\nFree admission.\n\nThe Ciompi Quartet's \"Portfolio Project\" began in the summer of 2020, when the Quartet commissioned a unique project from four composers in Duke Music's graduate program. The parameters of the commission were unorthodox: to find a solution to the compositional and performing challenges created by the Covid-19 pandemic by creating short works that could be practiced and recorded remotely by each member of the quartet.\n\nThe success of this initial project led the Quartet to commission three more works in 2021, and two in the summers of 2022 and 2023 from Duke graduate composers. It is these new works from last summer that will be heard on this program.\n\nSince its founding in 1965 by the renowned Italian violinist Giorgio Ciompi, the Ciompi Quartet of Duke University has delighted audiences and impressed critics around the world. All its members are professors at Duke, where they teach instrumental lessons, coordinate and coach chamber music, and perform across campus in concert halls, libraries, dormitories and classrooms. In a career that spans five continents and includes many hundreds of concerts, the Ciompi Quartet has developed a reputation for performances of real intelligence and musical sophistication, with a warm, unified sound that allows each player's individual voice to emerge.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Music","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Ruby Lounge","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Duke Music","email":"duke-music@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-24558317-00002ce7demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://music.duke.edu","submitted_by":["ethomps"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231213/55dcfd4acbf00bf933567caef34736a3-CR-Portfolio_Project_Logo_no_date_web_20230823093818PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Portfolio Project logo: Light green text on a blue, cloud-like background"},{"id":"CAL-2c918083-7bf1eaed-017c-150f18e4-0000595cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231214T050000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-12-14T05:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-09-12T04:00:00Z","summary":"Doing Good Employee Giving Campaign","description":"Doing Good, Duke's annual employee giving campaign, encourages Duke employees to donate to five community-identified need categories, including the United Way of the Greater Triangle.

Explore the multifaceted aspects of evaluating AI-generated content, emphasizing the importance of human evaluation in refining model performance.  \n \nOne of the highlights of the workshop is the discussion and exploration of various strategies to enhance AI models. AIs with personas of quality assurance inspectors which cycle to improve another AIs output will be explored. Attendees have the opportunity to gain practical insights into optimizing and customizing models to better suit specific tasks and domains, thus appreciating the potential for tailoring AI to their unique needs. \n \nIn this intellectually stimulating workshop, participants not only gain a deeper understanding of large language models but also acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to harness the full potential of AI in their respective fields.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"AI Health","co_sponsors":["+DataScience (+DS)","Biomedical Engineering (BME)","Biostatistics and Bioinformatics","Center for Computational Thinking","Computer Science","CTSI CREDO","Duke Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA)","Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","Pratt School of Engineering"],"location":{"address":"In person in CRTP 2 in Hock Plaza and virtual","link":"https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1CcCt5wY4j8cKk6"},"contact":{"name":"AI Health","email":"AIHealth@duke.edu"},"categories":null,"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-3e704521-00005d00demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1CcCt5wY4j8cKk6","submitted_by":["tmt26"],"presenter":"Presented by:  Sage Arbor, PhD., Sr. Informaticist,  Technology \u0026 Data Solutions, Duke Clinical Research Institute"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-c1bd4941-000027d2demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2024-01-26T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-01-26T18:00:00Z","summary":"CCN Colloquium: \"The role of CD8+ T cells in unhealthy diet-induced memory deficits in aged rats\"","description":"My laboratory focuses on the vulnerabilities of the normal aging brain that, when challenged, lead to long-lasting memory deficits. My lab has examined various triggers such as bacterial infection, surgery, and unhealthy diets that induce exaggerated and prolonged neuroinflammation in the aged brain. My lab has identified sensitized microglia as playing a key role in this exaggerated response. I have demonstrated that this potentiated neuroinflammatory response causes robust inhibition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, two molecular mechanisms critical to forming long-term memories. Furthermore, I have demonstrated that behavioral interventions such as exercise and reducing saturated fats from the diet can mitigate the exaggerated inflammatory response in the brain, and protect memory function.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Institute for Brain Sciences (DIBS)","co_sponsors":["Center for Cognitive Neuroscience","Psychology and Neuroscience"],"location":{"address":"LSRC - DIBS B035 Multipurpose Room","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=95"},"contact":{"name":"Tiffany Scotton","email":"tiffany.scotton@duke.edu"},"categories":["Medicine","Natural Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-c1bd4941-000027d2demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["dmv17"],"series-name":"CCN Colloquium","presenter":"Ruth Barrientos, PhD (Ohio State University)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2024/20240126/e87f8ab25a7bd95ad36b4e3d08868a9c-CR-Barrientos_Ruth_724x840_20230804061055PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Photo of Duke University architecture"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-41e65219-0000553ddemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2024-01-26T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-01-26T18:00:00Z","summary":"Department of Biochemistry Seminar, Stephen Floor, Ph.D, Assistant Professor, Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, UC San Francisco.
