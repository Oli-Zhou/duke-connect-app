Also known as Wang Min, DaoZi works in a style called Sacred Ink Wash Painting, through which he combines traditional Chinese ink painting techniques and materials with themes infused with his Christian faith. In Transcendence + Immanence, the artist uses the technique of ink wash painting to call for redemption, criticize darkness, and point to a spiritual world of universal values.\n\nOn display from October 20 to November 26, 2023, the exhibit focuses on a selection of representative pieces from the artist's vast body of work since 2007. The installation at Duke Chapel is the exhibition's premiere in the U.S. \n\nTo celebrate the exhibit's installation, DITA and Duke Chapel are hosting an opening reception on October 25 and a public lecture presented by the artist on October 26. Additional partnership and support for these events is provided by the Asian/Pacific Studies Institute and the Divinity School's Asian House of Studies and Historical Division.\n\nGallery Reception, with the Duke Chapel Choir\nWednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. 5 PM.

Compellingly, these techniques have become invaluable tools for applications ranging from topology optimization, to uncertainty quantification, to real-time prediction, to multi-scale modeling and beyond. Typically, researchers take either a \"problem-centric\" or \"model-centric\" approach to this work. Namely, they focus on either an overarching engineering challenge, or they focus on developing machine learning methods and model architectures. In this talk, we will present a \"data-centric\" approach to data driven modeling of mechanical systems. Specifically, we will discuss work where we focus on defining and curating datasets as our top priority [1]. First, we will share our work in developing and disseminating benchmark datasets for engineering mechanics problems [2, 3]. In addition to describing these datasets, we will also discuss our recent work in investigating deep learning model calibration [4]. Then, we will share our work in defining an open science based methodological foundation for data driven modeling of (bio)mechanical systems. In brief, we envision a methodological framework with three essential components: (1) open access datasets, (2) open source software to extract interpretable quantities of interest from these data, and (3) combined mechanistic and statistical models of (bio)mechanical behavior informed by these data. As an illustrative example, we will discuss our recent collaborative work in cardiac tissue engineering [5, 6]. Overall, the goal of this talk is to spark discussion and inspire future work on \"data-centric\" approaches to mechanical modeling. \n\n[1] https://imechanica.org/node/25935 \n[2] https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/39371\n[3] https://elejeune11.github.io/\n[4] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2023.104749\n[5] https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05322\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04610","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side A, room 1464","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98"},"contact":{"name":"Hinz, Nicolle","email":"nicolle.hinz@duke.edu","phone":"832-279-0092"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-14f92cd9-00001729demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"http://cee.duke.edu","submitted_by":["nh143"],"series-name":"CEE Fall Seminar Series 2023","presenter":"Emma Lejeune, Boston University, Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231106/4fc594972373782eba66ce5a63bc9f1a-CR-Lejeune_headshot[47]_20231009030555PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Emma Lejeune"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd0aa134-00000fc9demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-06T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-06T18:00:00Z","summary":"Prediction-driven Surge Planning with Application in the Emergency Department","description":"LUNCH: \nLunch will be served at 11:45 AM. \n\nABSTRACT: \nDetermining emergency department (ED) nurse staffing decisions to balance the quality of service and staffing cost can be extremely challenging, especially when there is a high level of uncertainty in patient demand. Increasing data availability and continuing advancements in predictive analytics provide an opportunity to mitigate demand uncertainty by utilizing demand forecasts. In this work, we study a two-stage prediction-driven staffing framework where the prediction models are integrated with the base (made weeks in advance) and surge (made nearly real-time) staffing decisions in the ED. We quantify the benefit of having the ability to use the more expensive surge staffing and identify the importance of balancing demand uncertainty versus demand stochasticity. We also propose a near-optimal two-stage staffing policy that is straightforward to interpret and implement. Lastly, we develop a unified framework that combines parameter estimation, real-time demand forecasts, and capacity sizing in the ED. Simulation experiments for the ED demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce annual staffing costs by 11%-16% ($2 M-$3 M) while guaranteeing timely access to care. \n\nSPEAKER BIO: \nJing Dong is the Regina Pitaro Associate Professor of Business in the Decision, Risk, and Operations Division at Columbia Business School.

In this lecture, I'll present some of the historical context for why this is and describe how Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity online. Targeted to an audience with general computing knowledge but no networking or security experience, students should leave this talk understanding both the basic technical mechanisms implemented by TLS to support the (largely invisible) work of creating secure communication channels and the distinction between the security goals of TLS vs. the security goals of user credentials. \n\nSPEAKER BIO: \nMelva T. James, PhD is a technical consultant at Ab Initio Software in Lexington, MA. They have a strong foundation in the planning and execution of scientific studies, data analysis, and technical communication, and they bring over a decade of expertise in STEM research.

These polymers can be to modulate SWNT electronic properties, provide expansive solubility, or organize functional organic moieties at predefined intervals along the SWNT surface. Such helically wrapped polymer-SWNT superstructures, for example, feature perylene diimide (PDI) electron acceptor unit positioned at 3 nm intervals along the nanotube surface, thus controlling rigorously SWNT-electron acceptor stoichiometry and organization. Potentiometric studies determine driving forces for photoinduced charge separation (CS) and thermal charge recombination (CR) reactions, as well as spectroscopic signatures of SWNT hole polaron and PDI radical anion states. Femtosecond pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopic experiments detail driving force- and solvent-dependent photoinduced CS and thermal CR dynamics, and provide insights into the factors that govern photoinduced charge transfer reactions at soft matter-hard matter interfaces defined by polymers and SWNTs (Figure 1c). Related systems in which a rigid polymer wraps a metallic nanotube surface modifies the energy-momentum (E-k) dispersion (band structure) of the tube, driving a metallic-to-semiconductor phase transition. This strategy contrasts approaches that regulate electronic structural properties of bulk-phase materials which rely on altering the nature of covalent bonding. Electronic spectral, chiro-optic, potentiometric, electronic device, and work function data corroborate that the magnitude of band gap opening depends on the nature of the polymer electronic structure. Polymer dewrapping reverses the conducting-to-semiconducting phase transition, restoring the native metallic carbon nanotube electronic structure. Because the energy separation between carbon nanotube valence and conduction bands depends on the polymer electronic structure, this approach provides a new approach to realize novel low band gap one-dimensional materials by design.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics (FIP)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366"},"contact":{"name":"Burns, August","email":"august.burns@duke.edu","phone":"660-5598"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-6bc5ad11-000037f9demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["ahb11"],"presenter":"Dr. Michael J.

After the sudden death of Sid's father Aaron, Sid and her boyfriend André trace a series of wacky clues Aaron irritatingly left to lead them to the solution of the mysterious disappearance of Sid's mother, a whale enthusiast named Dorothy, eighteen years earlier. Aaron also bequeathed them a manuscript sporting his wild ideas that his wife had been adopted by Yiddish speaking whales who try to save the planet.\n\nKatharine Dubois (who publishes historical romance novels as Katharine Ashe), is a USA Today bestselling novelist of more than twenty historical romance, including three awarded places on Amazon's Best Books of the Year lists.

Reparations discussions are strangely truncated. American and European parties are regularly called upon to remunerate, repair, and atone for colonial slave trade atrocities, but there is relative silence around continental African culpability in the transatlantic slave trade and how this involvement should be repaired for American descendants of slavery. In addition to monetary remuneration from American and European parties, Black nationalism has called for founding of African states, negotiated as land concessions and as reparations to Black Americans for continental Africans' historical role in the kidnapping and displacement of ADOS ancestors.\n\nWhat do the nuts and bolts of this process look like in the 21st century? What sort of political theory and intelligences have been brought to bear on conceiving and executing such a plan? Amer-African Statecraft addresses these considerations and more.\n\nSpeaker Biography: Solayman Idris pens for online and academic journals and lectures in the Middle East, the Caribbean and the United States. He is graduate of the North Carolina Central University Department of History and Editor in Chief of Luminfornt Scriptorium, a publishing house focused on forming an independent Black intelligentsia, the Orun Society. Most recently, Idris has authored his Times of the Signs trilogy which includes the books The Sunrise in the West, StarLogic, and Dusk Orientalis.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"John Hope Franklin Center (JHFC)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Duke University Middle East Studies Center"],"location":{"address":"John Hope Franklin Center, Ahmadieh Family Conference Hall, Room 240","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=2883"},"contact":{"name":"Dillard, Erin","email":"erin.dillard@duke.edu","phone":"919-668-1920"},"categories":["Caribbean focus","Middle East focus","Human Rights","United States Focus","Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Book Signing"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018ccf-8b87f80e-018b-96487f9a-00003206demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["eld12"],"series-name":"Wednesdays at the Center","presenter":"Solayman Idris","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231108/8dfa8549cd5c4c68442e0629993bda59-CR-118_Solayman Idris_20231103054334PM.png","image_alt_text":"Flyer with event information and image of author in black and white, african american"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-f5eaf7f1-00006beedemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-08T19:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-08T20:30:00Z","summary":"Pressures of the Research Environment","description":"Join an interactive event organized by ASIST.

More recently, with the wide adoption of smart home devices and high-functioning smartphones, conversational agents (e.g., Alexa, Siri) increasingly became available in people's everyday lives, such as Alexa, Siri, or automobile driver's interfaces. Furthermore, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has gained public attention, and the possibilities of generative conversational artificial intelligence (GCAI) systems show potential to support people's health in everyday lives. In this talk, I will discuss a few projects investigating the opportunities and challenges of GCAI becoming integrated into technology supporting various health needs, including mental health, parenting young children, and caregiving individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. I discuss various roles GCAI can play, its feasibility in interacting safely and appropriately with end-users and challenges that remain in GCAI becoming an integral part of health informatics applications.\n\t\nInstructor Biosketch:\nDr. Jina Huh-Yoo is an associate professor in the College of Computing and Informatics at Drexel University and a Director of the Master in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at Drexel.

Does this entreaty apply to the composition of poetry as well? To every sentence we form? Every thought that arises?\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI'm a poet whose primary research is in the field of Prosody. Prosody is the interplay between speech and song. It's the intonational, rhythmic, musical, interactive aspects of language. It is also definable as poetry's basic elements of composition (stress, intensity, pause, pitch, timbre, mood, etc.). Initially, I sought out Tibetan Medicine only in order to practice mantra (which is integral to Tibetan Medicine) as the most potent form of phonic sound.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a student of mantra ('mind protection') I had no intention of practicing Tibetan Medicine which is tantric (tantra, 'body protection'). During the pandemic, my Tibetan teacher made the decision to go online and teach Sowa Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan Medicine), and I accepted an invitation to be interviewed. My resistance to this medical practice was elemental: 5 element theory, the 3 humors, the 3 poisons, and the one primary cause of disease (ignorance, ma rigpa, or avidyā) were foreign to me. In the interview it was pointed out to me that the mandala from which Sowa Rigpa emanates (a garden called Tanaduk) is the abode of the poets (the rishis, the same sage/poets who received the Vedic hymns). Right away, I asked my teacher: what are the rishis doing in there? His answer basically reconstituted my life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI'd like to show the interrelationship between Sowa Rigpa and prosody, the composition of health, with prosody understood in this context as bearing properties such as vibration, vibrancy, timing, attuning, intoning, intent, interacting, proportioning, and equipoise.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlso on Zoom: \u003ca href=\"https://duke.is/9/3zb4\"\u003ehttps://duke.is/9/3zb4\u003c/a\u003e","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Humanities Unbounded","co_sponsors":["Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)"],"location":{"address":"Smith Warehouse, Ahmadieh Family Lecture Hall, Bay 4, C105","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1874"},"contact":{"name":"Gaglia, Nicole","email":"nyg3@duke.edu","phone":"919-684-2224"},"categories":["Medicine","Visual and Creative Arts","Asia focus","Humanities","Lecture/Talk","Religious/Spiritual"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a0382b5-8b29fde3-018b-3e9b089f-00005ec7demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://humanitiesunbounded.duke.edu/sowa-rigpa-treating-poetry-poetics-traditional-tibetan-medicine","submitted_by":["nyg3"],"webcast-url":"https://duke.is/9/3zb4","presenter":"Robert Kocik","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231108/73279d7becba51095cc57ca8be4ea9f3-CR-Entanglement SL - Kocik - 20231108 (1)_20231031052720PM.jpeg","image_alt_text":"Headshot of speaker with event information"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-42e4539f-000005e1demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-08T22:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T00:00:00Z","summary":"Keohane Distinguished Lecture: Memory, Representation, and the Power of Fiction","description":"Memory touches nearly every aspect of our lives and profoundly shapes culture.

The groundbreaking mission of Women Cross DMZ is captured in an intimate cinema vérité style, framed with historic newsreels of the Korean War, punctuated with dramatic contemporary news coverage.\n\nFrom threats of annihilation to promises of peace, U.S.-North Korea relations provide key moments of drama throughout the story. But the film's protagonists are thirty women activists who dare to tread forbidden territory to draw global attention to the unresolved war and demand a seat at the table in bringing about peace. Korean American Christine Ahn rallies the group, including feminist pioneer Gloria Steinem and Nobel Peace Laureates Leymah Gbowee and Mairead Maguire.\n\nThe intrepid team faces daunting political hurdles as they make their way toward the DMZ. The challenges the women face, the obstacles they overcome, and the solidarity and trust they build as they forge a path to peace with their Korean sisters, is an inspiring story of bridge building and collective action.\n\nAbout the speakers:\nDeann Borshay Liem is an Emmy Award-winning documentarian known for films that explore war, memory, family and identity including her landmark adoption films \"First Person Plural,\" \"In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee,\" and \"Geographies of Kinship.\" Her work on the Korean War, including \"Memory of Forgotten War,\" \"Crossings,\" and the oral history project, \"Legacies of the Korean War,\" explores divided families and women's role in peacemaking. She is a producer for the ITVS-supported film, \"Vivien's Wild Ride,\" and is directing a new documentary that looks at the intersections between US military occupation, Korean military brides, and transnational adoption.\n\nProfessor Suzy Kim is a historian and author of the prize-winning \"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950\" (Cornell 2013). Her latest book, \"Among Women across Worlds: North Korea in the Global Cold War,\" was completed with the support of the Fulbright Program and the National Endowment for the Humanities. As a public scholar, she has advocated for social justice and peace in Korea with Amnesty International USA, Truth Foundation, and Women Cross DMZ.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Asian American and Diaspora Studies"],"location":{"address":"Richard White Lecture Hall, Room 107","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=158"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Law","Asia focus","Multicultural/Identity","Ethics","Human Rights","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Movie/Film","Health/Wellness","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-bdd2b5bf-000041d6demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rmk33"],"series-name":"APSI Speaker Series","presenter":"Deann Borshay Liem (documentarian); Suzy Kim (Rutgers University)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231108/22d95c0d1f1ccbacc9916377b7d9fde7-CR-Crossings_Screening-DC_20231017084808PM.png","image_alt_text":"Still image from a film depicting women holding signs and banners at a protest event; descriptive text (event title, date, time, location, speaker names)"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-4bd1a923-00006e51demobedework@mysite.edu_20231109T003000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T00:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T01:30:00Z","summary":"'Text Messages' Bible Study","description":"This weekly \"Text Messages\" Bible study explores how Scripture can speak to contemporary issues from relationships with parents to the church and the legacy of slavery.

However, its role in magnetism remains poorly understood. I will discuss surprising experimental observations revealing a crucial role of the electron's orbital moment in ferromagnetism and elucidating a previously unrecognized connection between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity.\n\nOur magnetoelectronic measurements of heterostructures based on ultrathin transition metal ferromagnets revealed two separate magnetic order parameters: one associated with spin ordering at the Curie point Tc1, and another \"anomalous\" order parameter with a critical point Tc2 about 50K above the Curie temperature. Remarkably, magneto-optical measurements are not sensitive to the anomalous contribution, suggesting that the origin of the latter is qualitatively different from spin magnetism. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements show that the \"anomalous\" order parameter is associated with incipient orbital ferromagnetism whose signatures vanish below Tc2 without the onset of ferromagnetic orbital ordering. Electric current applied to micropatterned structures in this regime reveals that orbital magnetism is \"hidden\" but does not disappear below Tc2.\n\nI will show that these anomalous behaviors are captured by a simple Hubbard model of orbital correlations among nearest neighbor sites in an ultrathin ferromagnetic layer, leading to the conclusion that orbital moments form an orbital liquid [2] - a long-range correlated orbital state that lacks ordering due to the geometric orbital frustration, analogous to quantum spin liquids formed by frustrated spins and believed to hold the key to high-temperature superconductivity [3]. In the studied orbital liquid, orbital moments are ferromagnetically coupled, which would be impossible for spin liquid due to spin conservation. I will discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the mechanisms of magnetism and for the emerging field of orbitronics.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Physics","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Physics 298","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=94"},"contact":{"name":"Dina Weberg","email":"dina.weberg@duke.edu"},"categories":["Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-62756301-0000024bdemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rlf41"],"series-name":"Condensed Matter Seminar","presenter":"Sergei Urazhdin (Emory University)"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-d5c781d4-00003d49demobedework@mysite.edu_20231109T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T18:00:00Z","summary":"Critical Care Grand Rounds - \"Coagulopathy of acute infections and DIC\"","description":"Critical Care Grand Rounds occurs via Zoom on Thursdays from 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm EST, and is led by Drs.

RNA elements that promote genome selection have been identified, but the determinants of authentic packaging fidelity and efficiency remain unknown. We recently showed that heterogeneous transcriptional start site usage by HIV-1 produces 5′-capped RNAs beginning with one, two, or three 5′-guanosines (Cap1G, Cap2G, Cap3G, respectively) that are either selected for packaging as genomes (Cap1G) or retained in cells as translatable mRNAs (Cap2G/Cap3G). 2H-edited NMR structural studies revealed that the Cap1G transcript adopts a dimeric multi-hairpin structure that sequesters the cap, inhibits interactions with translation initiation factor eIF4E, and resists decapping. In contrast, the Cap2G/Cap3G transcripts adopt an alternate structure with an elongated central helix, exposed splice donor residues, and an accessible cap. Extensive remodeling, achieved at the energetic cost of a G-C base pair, explains how a single 5′ guanosine modifies the function of a ~9 kilobase HIV-1 transcript. Finally, using an NMR-directed competitive packaging approach, we show that cap sequestration is an essential determinant of HIV-1 genome packaging, likely preventing cap-dependent capture by the cellular RNA processing and translation machinery.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering (CBTE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366"},"contact":{"name":"Canning, Jessica","email":"Jessica.Canning@duke.edu","phone":"919-613-1321"},"categories":["Medicine","Engineering","Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-db1468e1-00007187demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jac228"],"series-name":"BioE Seminar Series","presenter":"Michael Summers, PhD","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/f01b5c579d8a0413ad9b84d0347236c6-CR-Summers-cropped_20230911031307PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Michael Summers Headshot"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-73147045-00001a45demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T21:00:00Z","summary":"NC Masters and Doctoral Virtual Career Fair","description":"Graduate and professional students and post docs in humanities/social sciences and STEM fields are cordially invited to participate in this virtual event put on by six North Carolina institutions (Duke, N.C.

Brett Ashley Kaplan, Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor for 2023-24, will be visiting Duke University and Carolina and will host this event from the UNC campus.\nKaplan's first public talk with take place at Duke University, at the Nasher Museum of Art on November 8, 2023.\nMemory, History and the Care for the Dead  with Hans Ruin, Södertörn University (Stockholm)\nThe talk takes its point of departure in the book Being with the Dead. Burial, Ancestral Politics, and the Roots of Historical Consciousness (Standford UP, 2019). It reconnects to Michel de Certeau's famous argument that historiography constitutes a cesura regarding the dead, as compared to older cultures of memory that preserve a living relation to the dead. The argument is that this definitive distinction between the work of memory and historiography disregards the deeper liaison between them, and the ways in which historiography can also be interpreted as a kind of sublimated mortuary culture.\nHans Ruin is professor of philosophy, with a PhD from Stockholm university and the co-founder of the philosophy department at Södertörn university. His work spans phenomenology and hermeneutics (Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer), deconstruction (translator of several books by Derrida), Nietzsche (co-director for Nietzsche's collected works in Swedish). For six years, he organized the largest memory-studies research program in Sweden and is currently also a Swedish representative on the board of the Mnemonics Network. His book, on which he will speak, was awarded the INTH prize for best book in the theory of history in 2022.\nBrett Ashley Kaplan received her Ph.D. from the rhetoric department at the University of California, Berkeley in 2002 and is now a professor and Conrad Humanities Scholar in the Program in Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

Previous research has shown that Candida albicans is hypersensitive to copper (Cu) dyshomeostasis in the presence of antifungal drug treatment by the popular triazole fluconazole. This work aims to investigate the ability of metal trafficking inhibitors to alter metal homeostasis in C. albicans. Toward this goal, we identified five compounds with demonstrated metal-trafficking protein inhibition from a literature review. One of the metal trafficking inhibitors tested, the Cu chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), was found by C. albicans growth assays to have antifungal properties, an activity that has not been documented previously . Data from ion-coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed significantly increased intracellular Mo levels, confirming that TTM internalizes into the cell. Utilizing bulk proteomic methods to measure protein stability changes, we found that TTM treatment results in altered stability of metalated proteins such as cytochrome c, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), the flavo-hemoglobin nitric oxide dioxygenase (Yhb1), and the multicopper oxidase Fet31. TTM treatment destabilizes Sod1 and increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden while stabilizing and upregulating the compensatory Yhb1. Upon comparison of TTM's antifungal activity to that of the extracellular Cu chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), we determined that TTM's activity is not due to Cu chelation and subsequent deprivation, as BCS does not inhibit C. albicans growth or impact the metalloproteome stability in the same way. Additionally, inhibiting the upregulated and stabilized Yhb1 during TTM treatment with azole antifungals with known Yhb1 inhibiting capabilities resulted in synergistic antifungal activity as determined by checkerboard growth assays. The combined inhibition of Yhb1 with TTM treatment is a promising antifungal development avenue.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Chemistry","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"FFSC 3225"},"contact":{"name":"De La Cruz, Claudia","email":"claudia.delacruz@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-8472"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-718149bc-000005bademobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cd111"],"presenter":"Katherine McAuliffe, Ph.D. Candidate","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/a19ab3e8ce350b6328059fbf57247d33-CR-GRAD-Mcauliffe,Katherine-11-09-23_20231027021940PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Ph.D. Defense- McAuliffe, Katherine"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd2e0064-0000136edemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T20:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T21:00:00Z","summary":"Duke BME Diversity, Equity \u0026 Inclusion Committee presents “The Meyerhoff Program at UMBC: Successful and replicable approaches for enhancing inclusive excellence in STEM”","description":"Academics across all science, technology, engineering, and related fields with an interest in increasing diversity and access in STEM are invited to hear from Dr. Michael Summers.  \n\nThe Meyerhoff Scholars Program at UMBC is a nationally recognized model for increasing retention and academic performance of URM undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs. Meyerhoff includes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds who are interested in issues of diversity and inclusion in STEM. Since 1993, the program has graduated more than 1500 students, of which more than 426 alumni have earned PhDs, 74 have earned MD-PhDs, 160 have earned MDs, and 330 have earned Master's degrees (some on the way to a PhD). More than 200 additional alumni are currently enrolled in STEM graduate and professional programs. 71 alumni currently hold faculty appointments. Qualified high school students who declined Meyerhoff offers and attended other universities were half as likely to graduate with a STEM degree and approximately 5 times less likely to pursue or complete STEM graduate degrees. Despite being medium sized university with a modest population of African American students (~12,000 undergraduates, 14% African American) UMBC is the top undergraduate school of origin of African American STEM PhD and M.D.-Ph.D. recipients in the U.S. To determine if Meyerhoff like outcomes could be achieved at other Majority research institutions with different URM compositions, geographies, institutional sizes, and cultures, but with like-minded leadership, we established partnerships with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Pennsylvania State University. Five-year outcomes indicate that the program can be adopted at other institutions, with outcomes immediately matching or exceeding the Meyerhoff Program. Approaches that leverage lessons learned from successful programs like Meyerhoff with inter-institutional partnering could serve as a general paradigm for expanding inclusive excellence in STEM.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Biomedical Engineering (BME)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366"},"contact":{"name":"Adams, Happi","email":"happi.adams@duke.edu","phone":"919-724-6458"},"categories":["Diversity/Inclusion","Engineering","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-dd2e0064-0000136edemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["mha32"],"presenter":"Michael Summers, PhD","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/7ce958822fdb13125a8f5f84bf9dfe36-CR-Duke BME DEI - Michael Summers - Nov 9 - Meyerhoff _20231010012322PM.png","image_alt_text":"The title of the talk and a picture of Dr. Michael Summers against an orange background."},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-3dc51b1b-000022c5demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T20:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-09T22:00:00Z","summary":"Faculty Service-Learning Reading Group","description":"How do we facilitate student empowerment and agency in times of change? \nLet's meet to explore themes presented in Faculty Service-Learning Guidebook: Enacting Equity-Centered Teaching, Partnerships, and Scholarship.

He was surprised to find foreigners in such a remote area, and even more surprised at what they were selling: women's lingerie.\n\nFor the next two years, Hessler made repeated research trips to Upper Egypt, where he learned that independent Chinese entrepreneurs were selling lingerie in almost every city. Before living in Egypt, Hessler had spent eleven years in China, and this project allowed him to combine his interests and skills in China and Egypt, Mandarin and Arabic. It also allowed him to untangle a mystery: How had entrepreneurs from an obscure part of Zhejiang province found their way to an even more obscure part of Upper Egypt, and how did they decide to focus on this unusual product?\n\nThrough telling the stories of average people, Hessler reveals larger trends in societal upheavals and re-sedimentation. His talk will explore lived realities surrounding China's meteoric rise and Egypt's unanticipated revolution. \n\nDrawing from his in-depth coverage of both regions, Hessler will provide insightful comparisons across histories and cultures while elucidating his singular method of finding the story.\n\nIntro by Prasenjit Duara, Oscar L. Tang Family Distinguished Professor of East Asian Studies in the Department of History.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nSince 2000, Peter Hessler has been a staff writer at The New Yorker. He first went to live in China's Sichuan province as a Peace Corps volunteer, from 1996 to 1998, an experience that became the subject of his first book, \"River Town.\" With Hessler's next two books, \"Oracle Bones\" and \"Country Driving,\" he completed a trilogy of reported works that spanned a decade in China. In 2011, he moved with his family to Cairo, where he lived for five years. His fifth book, \"The Buried,\" described his experiences during the Egyptian Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2019, Hessler returned to China, where he taught for two years at Sichuan University. He also covered the pandemic for The New Yorker, reporting from Wuhan and other cities. This experience is the subject of his newest book, \"Other Rivers,\" which will be published summer 2024. Hessler currently lives in southwestern Colorado with his wife, the writer Leslie T. Chang, and their twin daughters.\n\n**This event is co-sponsored by APSI, DUMESC and AMES with support from the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund**","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Duke University Middle East Studies Center"],"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Library Holsti-Anderson Family Assembly Room 153","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1872"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Law","Climate","Sustainability","Africa focus","China focus","Middle East focus","Asia focus","Ethics","Human Rights","United States Focus","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Global","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-05c7eb19-00003e63demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rmk33"],"presenter":"Peter Hessler (The New Yorker)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231109/58c056a8316d23a796291b4099649ff5-CR-Hessler_Calendar_20231010122141PM.png","image_alt_text":"Headshot of Peter Hessler; descriptive text on a blue background (title, date, time, location)"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-72930768-0000159bdemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-09T22:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T00:00:00Z","summary":"“Sparking Stewardship”","description":"Following a decade and a half of establishing their international artistic and musical solo careers, Marlena Novak and Jay Alan Yim founded localStyle in 2000 as a platform for collaboration, addressing issues of climate change and extractivism and expanding to focus on non-human others via themes such as the mating behavior of non-binary marine flatworms, the sonification of electric fish, speculative blackbird grammar, the illusory logic underlying human taxonomic systems, and the crisis facing coral reefs, whom they consider the voice of the Anthropocene.

Breakfast is served at 9 am, and the lecture begins promptly at 9:30 am.\n\n\"Epic Errancy: The Renaissance Virago and her Macabre Genealogies\"\n\nA site of intertextual interplay, epic poetry produces genealogical reflections that blur the edges between fiction and history. If it is often the epic project to transform, so as to efface, the perceivable bounds between legend and chronicle, where do figures fall who play no substantial role in epic's dynastic trajectory? This talk turns to one such figure, the virago, to account for her particular set of genealogies-discursive and historical-represented in Italian chivalric romance epic and its reception. My case study concerns the parallel developments in the myths and legends associated with the Ferrarese noblewoman, Marfisa d'Este (1554-1608), and her literary counterpart Marfisa, the female knight from Matteo Maria Boiardo's and Ludovico Ariosto's chivalric epic poetry. Through the Este princess's embrace of her cross-dressed poetic self in courtly performance, alongside the variations of the figure \"Marfisa bizzarra\" (bizarre Marfisa) in Italian mock epic, the intermedial afterlives of these two figures transformed from emblems of exemplarity into nearly unrecognizable icons of demonic decadence. Per the descriptions later offered by tourists Dickens and Goethe, the reconfigurations of utopic-turned-grim Ferrara-the city whose poetry gave birth to both Marfisas-participated in these women's haunting reception from the fifteenth through twenty-first centuries. The inquiries into gender and women's history developed in this study ask to what extent the legacies of Renaissance women have undergone not only category-confounding textual and visual transformations, but grotesque, even macabre misfigurations. \n\nKate Driscoll is Assistant Professor of Italian and Romance Studies at Duke University (Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley).

From recent knowledge of the channel, new applications and AI/ML opportunities become clear.  The talk highlights advances in modeling the spatial and temporal nature of radio channels, including the impact of antenna patterns and received signal envelopes of received signals, thereby offering insights into phenomena that can be used in learning models for artificial intelligence (AI) to predict signal behavior in real-world channels. Special emphasis is given to the relatively new Two-Wave With Diffuse Power (TWDP) distribution that encompasses Raleigh and Rician fading as special cases, and repeatable measured phenomenon of diffraction effects when a receiver  encounters an object that physically begins to block a radio path. New approaches that learn the directions of arrivals and the extent of multipath from simple narrowband envelope measurements, and how to optimize and learn channel behaviors from ray tracing are also presented, thus offering insights into promising ML/AI approaches to physical layer prediction and learning.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Hudson Hall 125","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=101"},"contact":{"name":"Rice, Cynthia","email":"cynthia.rice@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-5252"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-9a1f6333-00003368demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cpr24"],"presenter":"Theodore Rappaport","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/864f28a3c9f25811e944c690d372aa23-CR-Theodore Rappaport_20230927033158PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"THEODORE RAPPAPORT"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-6dcb6e7b-00006665demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-10T19:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T20:30:00Z","summary":"Climate Migration \u0026 Food Security","description":"Join us for a thought-provoking panel event that delves into the critical intersection of climate migration and food policy, presented by the Program on Climate-Related Migration (PCRM), the Duke Center for International Development (DCID), and the South-North Scholars (SNS).

He was the founding lead guitarist of the seminal Chinese heavy metal band Tang Dynasty and continued to be active in rock music in China until 2016. After several years as a reporter covering tech and society in China in the 2000s, he joined Baidu, China's leading search engine, as director of international communications. Since 2016, when The China Project acquired the Sinica Podcast, he has served as Head of Podcasts and edits and produces several podcasts under The China Project. He lives in Chapel Hill but is neutral when it comes to basketball allegiances.\n\n--Peter Hessler--\nSince 2000, Peter Hessler has been a staff writer at The New Yorker. He first went to live in China's Sichuan province as a Peace Corps volunteer, from 1996 to 1998, an experience that became the subject of his first book, \"River Town.\" With Hessler's next two books, \"Oracle Bones\" and \"Country Driving,\" he completed a trilogy of reported works that spanned a decade in China. In 2011, he moved with his family to Cairo, where he lived for five years. His fifth book, \"The Buried,\" described his experiences during the Egyptian Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2019, Hessler returned to China, where he taught for two years at Sichuan University. He also covered the pandemic for The New Yorker, reporting from Wuhan and other cities. This experience is the subject of his newest book, \"Other Rivers,\" which will be published summer 2024. Hessler currently lives in southwestern Colorado with his wife, the writer Leslie T. Chang, and their twin daughters.\n\n\n**This event is co-sponsored by APSI, DUMESC and AMES with support from the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund**","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","co_sponsors":["Asian \u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)","Duke University Middle East Studies Center"],"location":{"address":"Nasher Museum of Art Auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=208"},"contact":{"name":"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)","email":"apsi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Law","Climate","Sustainability","China focus","Middle East focus","Asia focus","Ethics","Human Rights","United States Focus","Civic Engagement/Social Action","Diversity/Inclusion","Global","Humanities","Politics","Social Sciences","Health/Wellness","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research","Technology"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-05dbc043-00003fe0demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["rmk33"],"presenter":"Peter Hessler (The New Yorker), Kaiser Kuo (Sinica Podcast)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/6afc964c10648652f15a5a01cca1a23e-CR-Hessler_Kuo_20231006043928PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Headshots of Peter Hessler (left) and Kaiser Kuo (right); center panel of descriptive text on a blue background (title, date, time, location)"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-812252e0-000059cbdemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-10T20:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T22:00:00Z","summary":"The Philosophy of Jeopardy","description":"What can \"Jeopardy!\" teach the world of philosophy, and vice versa?

It combines a Bayesian posterior distribution over the objective function with a decision-theoretic acquisition function that quantifies the value of objective function and constraint evaluations (\"experiments\").\n\nWhile BayesOpt is a black-box optimization approach, we have recently shown that \"peeking inside the box\" can improve performance by several orders of magnitude.  Key to this approach are statistical methods that incorporate additional information beyond the values of the objective function. For example, when optimizing quality in a manufacturing process, these methods incorporate observations of quality after each stage of the process, not just the quality of the final output.\n\nThis idea also offer a new way to interact with humans who have trouble choosing a single objective function. Rather than estimating a Pareto frontier like traditional multi-objective optimization methods, we can model the human as having a utility function drawn from a Bayesian prior.  By iteratively updating a posterior on the human's utility function in response to questions (\"which tradeoff between cost and quality do you like better?\") and using this knowledge to prioritize experiments, we can identify a set of solutions whose maximum utility is likely to be large. This approach better leverages information about user preferences to provide much better efficiency than traditional mult-objective methods.\n\nWe describe the ideas behind these approaches and how they are being used to design novel energy materials in collaboration and optimize online platforms.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Statistical Science","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Old Chemistry 116","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=99"},"contact":{"name":"Karen Whitesell","email":"Karen.Whitesell@duke.edu"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018ccf-8b87f80e-018b-a50d657b-000008eademobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["kherndon"],"series-name":"Statistical Science Seminar","presenter":"Peter Frazier Eleanor and Howard Morgan Professor Operations Research and Information Engineering Cornell University"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-ff03a46f-000032a4demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-10T20:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T21:30:00Z","summary":"Biology Seminar | Gustavo Silva, Assistant Professor of Biology | Thriving Under Pressure: Regulating Protein Dynamics Under Stress","description":"Professor Silva will discuss his current research.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Biology","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"French Family Science Center 2231","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=33"},"contact":{"name":"Blythe Boquist","email":"bbooher@duke.edu"},"categories":["Natural Sciences","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-ff03a46f-000032a4demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["bbooher"],"series-name":"Biology Seminars","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/c6fd2ff8f3dc74eb5229ca47a65ff077-CR-GustavoTenure Talk Banner2_20231106032036PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Gustavo banner"},{"id":"CAL-8a0290b4-860465b2-0186-a84fbe2e-00007f50demobedework@mysite.edu_20231110T220000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-10T22:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-10T22:15:00Z","summary":"Carillon Daily Recital","description":"Each weekday at 5:00 p.m., a carillonneur plays a fifteen-minute recital on the bells in the Duke Chapel tower.

The goal of this series is to empower students, faculty, and staff, to be the architect of their own wellness through creative expression and to share that through the self-published medium of Zines. Students may attend one or all of the workshops.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Arts","co_sponsors":["Duke Arts Create"],"location":{"address":"Duke Arts House 2101 Campus Drive"},"contact":{"name":"Wallace, Anna","email":"anna.wallace@duke.edu","phone":"919-672-2221"},"categories":["Visual and Creative Arts","Workshop/Short Course"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-82925c3a-0000758ddemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://arts.duke.edu/workshop/duwell-zine-series-november-10-2023/","submitted_by":["tew30"],"presenter":"Janelle Hutchinson","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/ab133b5af20d3e73c6558654b9ebac86-CR-Duke-Arts-Create_20231030095151PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Duke Arts Create logo"},{"id":"CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5e62f5ee-00005ce7demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-11T00:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-11T00:00:00Z","summary":" Screen/Society--\"De Humani Corporis Fabrica\" (Verena Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor, 2022)","description":"Film screening:\n\n\"De Humani Corporis Fabrica\"\n(Verena Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor, 2022, 118 min, France, DCP)\n\nFive centuries ago, anatomist André Vésale opened up the human body to science for the first time in history.

He partners with a local non-profit organization that works side by with locals to help rebuild Haiti. After volunteering in a displacement camp, he heads to the heart of downtown. In Port-au-Prince he samples Haitian cuisine, competes in a rap competition, and works with a celebrated metal artisan to create art out of trash. He discovers the harsh reality about survival in Haiti when he meets a sixteen-year-old prostitute who's found work near the now-collapsed capital building. Even in the pit of despair he meets a young boy with a mile-long smile, flying a kite made out of a garbage bag. From the Canaan displacement camp to the beating heart of Port-au-Prince, it's clear that in Haiti, the human spirit will not be broken.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS)","co_sponsors":["Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)","Libraries","Romance Studies"],"location":{"address":"Zoom","link":"https://duke.is/5/nysx"},"contact":{"name":"Jacques Pierre","email":"jacques.pierre@duke.edu"},"categories":["Central America focus","Caribbean focus","Human Rights","Global","Politics","Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-82973664-000075eddemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jprather"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231110/9dffe3551d7cac887d51a414441ec4b6-CR-haitian film series 4 cal_20231027101825PM.png","image_alt_text":"flyer for 2023 Haitian Film Series"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-236676cf-000013eddemobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-11T00:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-11T00:00:00Z","summary":"Duke Opera Theater \u0026 Duke Chorale: Great Moments from Great Operas","description":"Excerpts from \"Carmen,\" \"Treemonisha,\" \"Dialogues of the Carmelites,\" \"Nabucco\" and more.\n\nDuke Opera Theater is directed by David Heid and accompanied by pianist Daniel Seyfried.
